<br>Milk was one of the favorable foods of the human evolution.
<br>A lot of tribes had milk in their diet.

<br>Some had the practice of drinking it combined with animal blood.


<br>There not only where a lot of African tribes but also some relicts of antient times show that it was already used there.
<br>There where Egyptian hieroglyphs found talking about it. And there are even findings of the bronze and iron ages where they had clay "bottles" in which they stored milk.
<br><br>
<br>The purpose of milk in mammals is actually to give all needed nutrients to a small animal/child to grow and gain weight as fast as possible.
<br><br>
<br>Dairy especially raw dairy is a wonder food.
<br>When we take milk as the example it has a perfect ratio of the 3 macro nutrients (carbs/fat/protein). 
<br>Milk contains 2500 proteins. Also 400 types of fatty acids.
<br><br>
<br>The high amount of heat with pasteurization denatures proteins (enzymes), breaks down antibody effects, and kills good bacteria. We also kill or harm over 350 fatty acids. Also it gets rid of lactase (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="All about dairy > Lactose intolerance and how raw milk solves it" data-href="All about dairy#Lactose intolerance and how raw milk solves it" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/all-about-dairy.html#Lactose_intolerance_and_how_raw_milk_solves_it" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Benefit of lactase</a>).
<br>However killing off the bacteria doesn't get rid of them so you simple drink the dead bacteria.
<br><br><br>
<br>Basically in the 19 hundreds the hygiene was not good on farms and that's why more people got ill due to the infections through raw milk that's when they introduced pasteurization. Also animals were fed with low quality stuff.
<br><br>
<br>The whole pasteurization process is to get rid of pathogens.
<br>Without pasteurization there is a 20-40% chance of occurrence and with pasteurization there is still a 9-10% likelihood.
<br><br>
<br>Raw milk has lot of things in it that keep it from becoming a pathogenic breathing ground.
<br>The numerous bioactive components that kill off pathogens in the milk (some of them are lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, antibodies, medium chain fatty acids, lysozyme, B12 binding protein, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria)
<br>There are also ones that prevent pathogen absorption across the intestinal wall (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, mucins, fibronectin, glycomacropeptides, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria)
<br>Furthermore there are components that strengthen the immune system (lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, antibodies, hormones and growth factors)
<br>We additionally form also a safety system through fat in the form of medium chain fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins A and D.
<br>All this combined protects the body.
<br>Important: You always want the best quality of raw milk and pasture raised (more illness in the animal otherwise) this will make the milk saver.<br><br>
<br>The grain feeding has an impact on the quality of milk.
<br>Also the fat in the grass fed milk is higher in CLA and other nutrients.
<br>More on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed" data-href="Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/grass-fed-vs.-grain-fed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">grass fed vs. non grass fed</a>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>The general benefit is that it contains more of the nutrients due to it being natural and not changed in any way. This leads to a lot of health benefits.
<br><br>
<br>The wulzen factor was discovered by Rosalind Wulzen.
<br>The effect of it is:

<br>Anti stiffness in the joints
<br>Anti inflammatory 


<br>Raw dairy is the single best source of MSM which is also good for the joints.
<br><br>
<br>With drinking raw milk we generally have a better metabolization. And in addition will have more energy.
<br><br>
<br>Pasteurized milk doesn't contain the enzyme lactase which actually helps to break down lactose, however raw milk does.
<br>Due to drinking the pasteurized milk we also develop a lactase persistency.
<br>Thus drinking raw milk helps us to better metabolize dairy products containing lactose.
<br><br>
<br>You should be aware that a lot of processed foods also contain lactose in them. Even in things you wouldn't think so.
<br><br>
<br>Although if you are lactose intolerant and you want to add raw dairy to your diet then begin slowly, a good alternatives that are better to metabolize are kefir and Joghurt (less lactose due to fermentation). They are also both less inflammatory and they provide additional healthy bacteria to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Fiber" data-href="How metabolism works#Fiber" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Fiber" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">gut microbiome.</a>

<br>Although be aware that yoghurt often is only available in pasteurized form.


<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fermented food" data-href="Fermented food" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/fermented-food.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Other beneficial fermented foods for the gut microbiome</a> 
<br><br>
<br>After about 1-2 weeks using raw dairy in your diet you can see changes in the immune system.
<br>You'll in general strengthen the immune system and also recover better.
<br><br>
<br>After 2-3 weeks you'll also see the effects of better mental acuity and better mood.
<br>You'll be also less hungry.
<br><br>
<br>Lower risks of heart attack
<br>Also milk intake is correlated with lower risk of cancer
<br>Reduced risk in diabetics type 2
<br>Provides lots of protein to keep our muscles
<br><br>
<br>In a study showed children growing up drinking raw milk have less allergic conditions, Asthma, eczema. It also improves there overall immune system.
<br>Raw cow milk actually has the same protective effect then breast milk for children.
<br><br>
<br>There have been reports that when women who struggled with breast feeding and then drank raw milk where able to improve there ability to breast feed.
<br><br>

<br>
Thinks igf1 concerns about milk are not really needed

<br>
mTor and igf1 are actually good for humans

<br><br><br>
<br>Milk is literally a power food full of nutrients.
<br>The nutrients in half a liter of raw full fat milk:

<br>336 calories

<br>17g protein
<br>30g carbs
<br>17g Fat
<br>52% Calcium
<br>28% Vitamin A
<br>In general it has lots of B vitamins

<br>125% Vitamin B12
<br>Also has vitamin B2 (which usually get eighter through dairy or organ meat)


<br>17% Folate (especially good for pregnant women)
<br>20% Potassium

<br><br>
<br>The difference is in the proteins.
<br>A1:

<br>More inflammatory and G1 problems.
<br>Also A1 could be associated type 1 diabetes (better not feed kids with it)


<br>A2:

<br>Is the better option.
<br>It leads to less bloating and digestive inflammation
<br>Better for people sensitive with milk


<br><br>
<br>Colostrum is basically the first milk a mammal gets from its mother.
<br><img alt="ColostrumVsMatureMilk.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/colostrumvsmaturemilk.png" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;">
<br>You can drink colostrum without any thought about taking it away from the baby cow cause the female cow tends to always overproduces it.
<br><br>
<br>Only source of two growth factors
<br>Beneficial for the immune system and improvement in recovery (also good for wound healing).
<br><br>
<br>Study that showed almond milk was related to kidney stone, painful urination and recurring bladder infections.
<br><br>
<br>Raw cheese (Parmesan reggiano)

<br>If want raw cheese don't want it to be heated over 38-40 degree Celsius.


<br>Yoghurt
<br>Kefir
<br>raw Butter and ghee
<br>Other dairy products
<br><br>
<br>Homogenization is when break down fat in little parts. This leads to destroying all 400 types of fatty acids.

<br>There are many different types of breathwork. 
<br>Some sorts of breathwork types are:

<br>shamanic
<br>vivation
<br>pranayama
<br>transformational
<br>holotropic

<br>"The presence of oxygen is the absence of disease" - <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="@Garry Brecka" data-href="@Garry Brecka" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/@Garry Brecka" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gary Brecka</a>
<br>The importance of oxygen was basically discovered with the Otto Warburg effect. Basically saying <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Cells and cell doubling" data-href="How metabolism works#Cells and cell doubling" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Cells_and_cell_doubling" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">oxygen is closely related to cell function</a>.
<br><br>
<br>Breathwork therefore has many benefits such as with depression/mood/digestion/ and even increasing the bodies ability to absorb certain nutrients and helping microbiome.
<br>Overall this combined with <a data-href="other tools" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/other tools" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">other tools</a> improves longevity.
<br>Also if you activate your diatreme more you basically exercise it which is also good.

 <br><br>
<br>In our body we have adenosine which taps into the ATP pathway (energy pathway) and makes us feel tired 
<br>Caffein binds to adenosine receptors and prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components of energy pathway and cyclic amp increases. This leads to delaying the timing of the sleepy signal.
<br>So we don't really create new energy we just borrow it.
<br>Adenosin is lower in the mornings. To really get down there you should avoid caffeine intake in the first 90-120 minutes of waking. Otherwise you'll probably have a afternoon crash.
<br>The only way to clear out adenosine is to sleep, take a nap, also intense exercise can decrease it.
<br>To cleat it out completely you want to have a cortisol spike and you want that early in the day.

<br>Best to view sunlight up to 1h after waking
<br>20-30 min outside good


<br>So caffeine reduces fatigue and sleepiness.
<br><br>
<br>Not really good cause take caffein in afternoon
<br>90min naps or NSDR all increase dopamine and also improve mood alertness on its own
<br>Also caffeine probably reduces the effects of the nap
<br><br>
<br>Intake:

<br>90-120 minutes after waking
<br>Caffeine on empty stomach more intense effect
<br>If really want the best effects then either take some days off it or use it on empty stomach
<br>Last intake not after 12h before sleep


<br>Dose:

<br>The dose can be very individual, not everybody has the same response

<br>For most people 1-3mg caffeine per kg bodyweight is range where it will have a positiv effect

<br>That's one dose. If you want to take caffeine multiple times a day you should divide the amount of the dose.




<br>To much isn't that good


<br><br>
<br>Tolerance without feeling anxious depends on:

<br>Preexisting Disposition (genetic, how much stress in life, etc.)

<br>And how caffeine adapted you are (if alert and relaxed then probably not adapted)




<br>Jitteriness:

<br>Can be due to low sodium and other minerals cause caffeine is a diuretic.

<br>Solution: salt + water


<br>Other solution is theanine

<br>Green tea has it
<br>200-400mg of it are effective to offset the jitteriness




<br><br>
<br>We can eighter have a conscious reward (For example financial, recognition, ...) or a subconscious one (reward of caffein).
<br>Caffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in body that act as reinforcers and they do it subconsciously. It does this by stimulating the reward pathway in a different way then the usual addiction/reward path.
<br>Caffeine also increases Dopamine receptors in the reward pathway therefore if you then experience something positive it will have a much more potent effect. In addition it increases the dopamine itself.
<br>Caffeine also reinforces the whole experience you where in when drinking something with caffeine.
<br>In addition we associate a taste positively through caffein as a reinforcement. That's why people like the bitter taste of coffee.
<br><br>
<br>
In nature lot of plants contain little caffeine, so little that you won't notice it, or they have more prominent other flavors.

<br>
Especially flowers use this, and that acts as a reinforcer for bees to go to that flowers and prefer those.
<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Reinforce and Aversive Agents" data-href="Reinforce and Aversive Agents" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/reinforce-and-aversive-agents.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">More about reinforcers</a>

<br><br>
<br>Mental performance:

<br>Caffeine improves our reaction time/alertness/memory/focus and mood.

<br>With mood it can also have antidepressant effects


<br>It also can help as memorize in two ways:

<br>Before mental task
<br>After mental task

<br>This works cause you'll have a spike in adrenaline. We humans learn better when we are under stress that is in our animalistic nature. For example if we had a near death experience with a lion we had to remember that experience more then something else, to protect ourselves.




<br>So we can eighter have a Dopamin spike, which is a positive surprise, or adrenaline which is eighter positiv or negative.
<br>We could get the same effect of adrenaline also through a cold shower or a intense workout (needs to be 10-50 minutes afterwards)


<br>Physical Performance:

<br>Also taking caffeine prior to working out has some positive effect. It increases dopamine release when exercising and that leads to better mood, increased alertness, focus and motivation even hours after the exercise.
<br>Also over time you'll reinforce exercise (like it more)

<br>In addition it improves power output and endurance.




<br><br>
<br>Most studies based on abstinence cause 90% of the population drink caffeine.
<br>Abstinence and reuse has higher effect then just taking caffein regularly. Even 2 days abstinence shows already effects.
<br>For the best effects you can use 20 days. 
<br>So a non regular intake could be benefitial.
<br><br>
<br>Beneficial for weight loss, mental performance and controlling blood sugar levels
<br>It also makes us less hungry.
<br>Yerba mate:

<br>Yerba mate stimulates the glp-1 release

<br>Shouldn't consume smoked variants of yerba mate cause they are carcinogenic (pro cancer causing)




<br><br>
<br>It might  reduces some of the probability of getting Parkinsons and Alzheimer's disease
<br>Caffeine has neuroprotective effect
<br>Helps with asthma
<br>Improves attention in ADHD patients
<br>positiv effect on depression
<br><br>
<br>One myth about caffeine is that it can increase osteoporosis (if enough calcium in diet no problem)
<br>Other myth is that reduce/increase testosterone/estrogen (no real consistent changes, but increases sex hormone binding globulin which effects free testosteron/estrogen)
<br><br>
<br>Caffein is a diuretic that means it promotes urination and therefore you'll also lose minerals like sodium, potassium or magnesium.
<br>The solution is to take increase water intake intake 2:1 ratio for every volume of caffein.

<br>To absorb oxygen by the tissues you need CO2
<br>That's why when someone is hyperventilating you then give them a paper bag to breath in. they then have more co2 which leads to oxygen being taken.
<br><br>
<br>Increase in activation of parasympathetic nervous system
<br>Co2 is anti tumor
<br>Co2 also ant inflammatory
<br><br>
<br>After thunderstorm you typically get more co2 in air or you also have it in hot springs.
<br><br>
<br>Carbonated pools also can be good.
<br><br>
<br>Could be more acidic though (have to look into that)

 <br><br>
<br>Water is 29 times more thermal effective then air. This is why its so effective.
<br>This thermal effectiveness is also why you can die of 22 decree celsius water and not from air.

<br>Story of 3 NFL players on fishing trip


<br><br>
<br>When you get the cold exposure the arteries will spasm down to clamp all blood and force it into the core and the brain. The increased amount of blood there is already a benefit.
<br>This basically exercises the smooth muscle by contracting and loosening.
<br>Smooth muscle is the muscle that lines our arteries. 
<br>Therefore this also exercises our cardiovascular system.
<br><br>
<br>If the exposure was cold enough the liver releases cold shock proteins.
<br>When these proteins hit the bloodstream they get rid of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Free Radicals" data-href="Free Radicals" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/free-radicals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">free radicals</a>. In addition they even increase protein synthesis (muscle repair).
<br><br>
<br>When getting cold exposure you'll also release dopamine which will effect you even several hours after the exposure.
<br><br>
<br>Cold exposure also leads to activation of <a data-href="brown fat" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/brown fat" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">brown fat</a> (our thermostat).
<br>Mitochondria has a affinity for it.
<br>It also helps to burn fat.
<br><br>
<br>Cold exposure has a variety of benefits like:

<br>reduced inflammation
<br>increased metabolism
<br>it helps to lower blood sugar and benefits insulin sensitivity
<br>better mood
<br>better focus 
<br>improved sexual satisfaction (could be to testosterone increase)
<br>improved anxiety regulation
<br>It even helped with fat loss


<br><br>
<br>You shouldn't use a cold plunge in the time of 6h after strength training. This is due to the fact that this then negatively impacts muscle growth. Although cold showers don't affect that. 
<br><br>
<br>Before the cold shower/plunge you can do a warm shower before if you want.
<br>You should expose yourself to 3-6min of 8-10 degree celsius cold water. Actually 3min already has all the benefits.
<br>You also want to hit the head, back of your neck and your back these is cause there are big amounts of brown fat there.
<br>Hitting those areas especially triggers the adaptation of brown fat.
<br>After the exposure you should warm up naturally.

 <br><br>
<br>Dandruff is actually based on a normal process that is speeded up drastically due to certain factors.
<br>Normally its a monthly cycle in which the scalp resets.
<br>Dandruff is basically a overgrowth of a friendly fungus thats part of our normal flora. It's called malassezia fungus.
<br>The fungus feeds from fats (eats <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dry &amp; Oily hair > ^cfb744" data-href="Dry &amp; Oily hair#^cfb744" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/dry-&amp;-oily-hair.html#^cfb744" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">sebum</a>). But it only likes saturated fats and eats triglycerides and doesn't like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6 > Omega 6" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6#Omega 6" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html#Omega_6" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">omega 6</a>.
<br>The main cause is that we have a imbalance in the scalp microflora. Therefore also an imbalance between fungal and bacteria.
<br>But basically the real root cause comes from a disrupted gut microbiome.
<br><br>
<br>Head and shoulders uses the ZPT chemical which then kills microbes in scalp this means its anti fungal and bacterial. So it not only kills bad bacteria and fungal but also good ones.

<br>Actually banned in Europe cause it is toxic for the reproduction organs.


<br>Antibiotic actually also kills bacteria but the problem is that you also kill bacteria that keeps your fungus under control.
<br><br>
<br>Fix the microflora on the scalp:

<br>1tb of kimchi + water and then put that on scalp wait 15min (so you put probiotic back)
<br>Other option is 2tb olive oil, 1/2tb coconut oil rub it in then leave over night
<br>Apple cider vinegar can also help restore the microflora:

<br>1tb with 16 oz water
<br>Can use it once or twice a week




<br>Fix your diet thus the microflora in the gut:

<br>You should go low carb, low omega 6 avoid sugar and add back in some probiotics.


<br>Optimize your bathroom:

<br>Change shampoo
<br>Install a Shower filter

<br>There are many studies that show that when we are dehydrated our body and brain doesn't function as well (even 2% has impact)

<br>It effects physical performance, cognitive performance (memory, focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking)
<br>Dehydration can show up in brain fog


<br>Salt-Huberman<br>
Dehydration:<br>
- If drink to much water in short time you can actually kill yourself<br>
- That's called hyponotrimia<br>
- The problem is you excrete to much sodium quickly and ability to regulate kidney function is disrupted, and also brain actually could stop functioning<br>
- If the water doesn't have sufficient electrolytes<br>
- It's also this why dehydration leads to confusion and lack of coordination<br><br>

 <br><br>
<br>The sebaceous gland is responsible for releasing oil called sebum which lubricates and protects the surface of our skin. 
<br><img alt="SebaceousGland.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/sebaceousgland.png" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;">
<br><br>
<br>One of the major causes is deficiency in fat suable vitamins specifically vitamin A.
<br>Vitamin A helps regulating the sebaceous gland.
<br>Also a deficiency in vitamin D and E is playing into it.
<br><br>
<br>To get the vitamins could use cod liver oil.
<br>You can get vitamin E from leavy greens, nuts.
<br><br>
<br>The major cause of oily hair is low zinc which helps to reduce androgens and DHT.
<br>DHT is a powerful type of testosteron that can leads to increasing the size of the gland and therefore makes it produce more oil. 
<br>A other cause is a high level of insulin.
<br><br>
<br>Too many grains
<br>History of antibiotics
<br>Eating to much refined carbohydrates
<br>Digestive problems
<br>Alcohol
<br>Diarrhea
<br>Low HCL (hydrochlorothiazide) this leads zo not being able to absorb zinc and other minerals.

<br>Symptom would be a acid reflux


<br><br>
<br>Reduce as many of problems of zinc deficiency).
<br>And increase zinc:

<br>Seafood (like oysters)
<br>Red meat
<br>Liver (especially beef liver is high in zinc)


<br>Also <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Intermitten Fasting" data-href="Intermitten Fasting" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/intermitten-fasting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">intermitted fasting</a> can be beneficial.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Lack of essential fatty acids:

<br>One reason is the lack of omega 3 which also can come due to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">overconsumption of omega 6 fatty acids</a>.
<br>For good omega 3 sources go <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6 > What fatty foods to consume" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6#What fatty foods to consume" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html#What_fatty_foods_to_consume" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">here</a>.


<br>Vitamin B2 deficiency:

<br>This leads to try lips and eventually also to cracked corners of the mouth.
<br>Cause B2 is a anti microbial and you lack it you then can become infected with fissures (candida).
<br>Therefore it can be also caused by lack of microbiome.


<br><br>
<br>Vitamin b2 is actually a co enzyme that has the function of breaking down fats and ensuring that the skin is lubricated.
<br>Food that has vitamin B2:

<br>Eggs
<br>Leafy greens
<br>Nuts
<br>Dairy
<br>Meats and fish


<br>Deficiency can also come from birth control, being vegan and refined foods (especially carbs).
<br><br>
<br>Chapped lips is kind of a cross over with dry lips. 
<br>But chapped lips can be combination of deficiency in omega 3 and vitamin d, that's why you often see chapped lips in winter time.
<br>It also can be caused by a zinc deficiency.

<br>Zinc is in red meat and seafood.


<br>In seldom cases it can also be from a vitamin a overdose which only comes from supplementing it too much.
<br><br>
<br>The major problem with lip balsam is that it rather does the opposite of what it should do.
<br>This is due to its ingredients like alcohol/some solvents or mineral oil that pulls oil out of your lips and thus makes them dry. With its the same with <a data-href="handcreme" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/handcreme" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">handcreme</a>.
<br>Especially the mineral oil causes disruption in fat suable vitamins and the pulling out of oil.

 <br><br>
<br>The first type of fermented food is wild fermenting foods this means they naturally ferment on their own, examples for that would be sauerkraut or kimchi.
<br>The other type is a fermented food which is influenced by a starter culture that then leads to the fermentation, examples for that would be kefir, kombucha or yoghurt.
<br>Basically besides the fermentation technique there are no difference in the benefits of the both.
<br><br>
<br>Diary based fermented food is not only good for the microbiome it also provides a alternative to raw milk and therefore has lots of other <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="All about dairy" data-href="All about dairy" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/all-about-dairy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">benefits of raw dairy.</a>
<br><br>
<br>Yoghurt seems to be best source for microbial diversity.
<br>Kefir is pretty similar to yoghurt but it uses a different starter culture.

<br>It is better for people with sensitive gut because it contains galactosidase producing bacteria. These bacteria helps to break down lactose which finally leads to a 30% less lactose content.


<br><br>
<br>Yoghurt even natural yoghurt is often high in added sugars. The same applies for kefir. 
<br><br>
<br>Kombucha:

<br>There is not really much evidence (only vitro studies).
<br>Also has added sugar into it to just create the fermentation effect.


<br>Sauerkraut:

<br>Sauerkraut is an interesting candidate cause it doesn't really show a big effect on the microbiome but it has probiotic effects.
<br>Also Sauerkraut juice has a anti oxidant effect due to kaempferol and also increase glutathione (there to repair cells) products.


<br>Kimchi:

<br>Changes the microbiome even if its a similar plant as sauerkraut.
<br>Diverse amount of bacteria when starting with the starter culture but after some days it mainly has Leuconostoc bacteria in it.
<br>It also had a increases in short chain fatty acid producing bacteria


<br>Tempeh &amp; Natto:

<br>Fermented soy
<br>Also beneficial


<br>Also Pickles can be used.
<br><br>
<br>A few servings per week should do the job.

In addition it causes several toxin effects in the brain and is basically a neuro toxin.
<br>It also generates free radicals and leads to cause of several pathogenic conditions of the brain.
<br><br>
<br>52 of 55 studies showed a decreases in child IQ related to the fluoride consumption.
<br><br>
<br>Fluoride not only crosses the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How salt impacts our body > Blood Brain Barrier" data-href="How salt impacts our body#Blood Brain Barrier" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-salt-impacts-our-body.html#Blood_Brain_Barrier" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">blood brain barrier</a> it also can cross the placental barrier and can reach the fetal brain.
<br><br>
<br>Furthermore it disrupts our thyroid hormone system.
<br>The thyroid system has lots of important roles in brain and body. 
<br><br>
<br>Even 0.5mg per l of water can effect effect the thyroid hormone T3.
<br>Toothpaste with fluoride even needs to have a warning lable that says if children under age 6 use more then the typical dose then you need to contact poison control.
<br><img alt="ToothpasteWarningLable.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/toothpastewarninglable.png" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<br><br>
<br>The information of 26 studies that confirm the bad health effects of fluoride were suppressed and later released by a court order.
<br>The program that was suppressed was the national toxicicology program fluoride.
<br><br>
<br>So you want to minimize the amount of fluoride you consume as much as possible.
<br>So use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Recommended Products" data-href="Recommended Products" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/recommended-products.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener"><span class="iconize-icon-in-link" title="LiShoppingCart" aria-label="LiShoppingCart" data-icon="LiShoppingCart" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16px" height="16px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="8" cy="21" r="1"></circle><circle cx="19" cy="21" r="1"></circle><path d="M2.05 2.05h2l2.66 12.42a2 2 0 0 0 2 1.58h9.78a2 2 0 0 0 1.95-1.57l1.65-7.43H5.12"></path></svg></span>fluoride free toothpaste</a>.

<br>The basic problem is that food companies can use categories instead of having to mention one ingredient.
<br><br><br>
<br>Like sugar has over 262 names for it. So basically the only way to figure out if their is sugar in something is when you have a line for added sugars. 

<br><br>
<br>High fructose corn sirup:

<br>Labeled as all natural sugars, HFCS (shortform, also longform is used), also labeled as corn syrup/corn sugar/natural fructose flavoring/natural flavoring.


<br>Sodium nitrate:

<br>Its not a salt
<br>The cancer institute categorized it as not safe.
<br>

<br>Good is (labels like grass fed/uncured/free range/nitrate free)




<br>Aspartame which is used as an artificial sweetener:

<br>Has effects on behaviorale and cognitive function.


<br>Partially hydrogenated oils:

<br>Are trans fats and they actually don't have to lable it when there is less then half of a gram in it.
<br>On the lable look for hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated in front of a oils name.

 <br><br>
<br>Glp-1:

<br>Found in certain caffeinated drinks

<br>Benefitial for weight loss, mental performance and controlling blood sugar levels
<br>Acts on brain and body
<br>Reduces hunger by

<br>activating certain neurons in the hypothalamus

<br>And acts on certain receptors on the gut to make us feel full




<br>There are animals that use that to not eat for a long time
<br>Also drug that intimitates glp-1 (effective against obesity and diabetes, but those should only be used in extreme cases)
<br>Promotes thermogenesis (is utilization of metabolic energy)

<br>Beige, brown fat cells are fat cells you want more off (they generate heat, have lot of mitrochondria)

<br>Helps convert weight into brown/beige ones

<br>Cold shower has same effect


<br>Also raises base energy burning




<br>Other ways to release it is fasted exercise and certain formes of exercise




<br>Dr.Lustig -Huberman<br>
Glp1 (acts on brain and gut, decreases rate of gastric emptying)<br>
<br>Glp1 analogs (used for fat loss, is injected, loose same amount of muscle too so not good)

 <br><br><br>
<br>If a label says grass fed it doesn't have to mean that the animal never ate any grain.
<br>Farmers are allowed to feed there grass fed animals with grass in the beginning and finish them on grains. 
<br>If a animal is grass finished it only gets grass.
<br><br>
<br>It turns out that the animal that's fed with grains is actually the less healthy animal.
<br>Only 30 days of feeding grains will destroy 200 days of feeding grass.
<br>The animals show signs of metabolic syndrome. Which is actually what causes the marbling in meat.

<br>The animal has higher inflammatory markers, higher uric acid, higher homocysteine levels (cardiovascular problems), and higher niacinamide (form of vitamin B).


<br>The same happens to us when we overconsume carbs.
<br>Also the animals bones will look better and more healthier.
<br><br>
<br>Better omega 3 to omega 6 ratio
<br>in addition to that the omega 3 will be higher (3x DHA, 10x EPA)
<br>less <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6 > Linoleic acid" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6#Linoleic acid" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html#Linoleic_acid" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">linoleic acid</a>
<br>contains CLA (also a omega 3 fatty acid)
<br>Also they get light metals (magnesium etc.) from the soil.
<br>Through that they also get healthy bacteria thus they have more more microbial diversity.
<br>Higher Vitamins:

<br>vitamin A
<br>niacin (vitamin B form)
<br>vitamin C
<br>vitamin E


<br>More phytonutrients (like beta carotene)
<br>5x increase in antitumor metabolite (colon)
<br>Higher Carnosine (helps fat burning)
<br><br>
<br>They often contain higher amounts of Glyphosate (chemical that's also in roundup). Animals kept in areas free of GMO should have lower glyphosate levels though.
<br>Also grain fed has higher perfluoro alkylated substances, higher micro plastics.
<br>You also want organic grass fed to not have GMO's.

 <br><br>
<br>Basically with grounding we use the magnetism of the earth.
<br>We basically stand barefoot on grass/sand/dirt simply on the earth. When then discharge into the earth.
<br><br>
<br>There is a electron exchange so we basically discharge into the earth that leads to changing our electrical field in your body.
<br>Grounding can have a impact on the body's pH. This is cause pH is potential of Hydrogen so its a charge that therefore can be changed.
<br>The more acidic we become the more sick we become because disease can't thrive in a alkaline environment.
<br><br>
<br>When changing the electrical field we also repolarize the surface of your cells.
<br>Our cells repelling by charge is a positive thing, cause if they instead clump together they lose surface area to interact with nutrients and gases.
<br>This also helps to get more oxygen in the cell especially into red blood cells.
<br>It also restores iron channels which act as security to get waste out and nutrients/gases in.
<br>You also benefit the mitochondria which is there to create ADP.
<br><br>
<br>As little as 3-5 min of touching the earths surface barefoot will be enough to change the pH and the polarization of the body.
<br>You could actually see the difference of the blood under a microscope before and after grounding.
<br><img alt="BloodWithGrounding.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/bloodwithgrounding.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">
<br><br>
<br>Mimic the surface of the earth so basically the same. They are actually connected to the ground wire.

 <br><br>
<br>Honey without doubt is the favorite food of tribes if they found a bee hive they would go crazy for it. 
<br><br>
<br>60% fructose, 40% glucose
<br><br>
<br>Honey his a very nutrient rich food it not only contains lots of vitamins but also antioxidants.
<br>Nutrients that its especially rich in:

<br>Vitamin B
<br>Calcium, potassium


<br>All this leads to various health benefits like:

<br>Anti inflammatory
<br>Anti allergic
<br>Anti microbial and has a protective effect against metabolic syndrome.
<br>And lowering of blood pressure
<br>It might even be able to raise testosterone levels in men.


<br><br>
<br>Similar like with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="All about dairy > Raw vs Pasteurized" data-href="All about dairy#Raw vs Pasteurized" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/all-about-dairy.html#Raw_vs_Pasteurized" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">pasteurized dairy</a> we lose vital nutrients.
<br>So make sure you get raw honey.
<br><br>
<br>Study about response to honey, sugar, high fructose sirup

<br>Blood sugar was checked after 20, 60, 90, 120 minutes after ingestion (if want to check then use that)

<br>Also checked insulin levels
<br>Glucose response was same in all 3 the same (with people with normal glucose Toleranz)
<br>Also pretty similar with people with a impaired glucose Toleranz
<br>Insulin spike after all 3 also
<br>Also triglyceride levels also go up afterwards
<br>Also checked hsCRP (inflammation marker) only increased in people with impaired glucose tolerance

 <br><br>
<br>If you eat something not every part of it will be used as fuel for the body, there is the part of the food namely fiber that's used by the gut microbiome.
<br>Also not everything you eat has the same impact on your body.
<br><br>
<br>Two types:

<br>Soluble
<br>Insoluble


<br>The insoluble fiber forms a jell like fishnet the soluble plugs the holes in it, together they prevent the absorption from the 30 calories, they go further down the intestine to where the micro biome is.
<br>Feeding your gut (microbiome) is very good cause then the gut will turn it into things like short chain fatty acids which are protective against chronic metabolic diseases.
<br><br>
<br>If you are eat to much protein, and not utilize it for working out, then the amino acids are turned to organic acid by the liver and this is then used to feed the process that creates <a data-href="ADP (adenosine triphosphate)" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/adp-(adenosine-triphosphate).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">ADP (adenosine triphosphate)</a>. So all this is good.
<br><a data-href="ADP (adenosine triphosphate)" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/adp-(adenosine-triphosphate).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">ADP (adenosine triphosphate)</a> is the chemical energy our body needs to power itself.
<br>It also takes twice as much energy to prepare protein to burn as it takes to prepare a carb or fat to burn.
<br>Protein generates more heat.
<br><br><br>
<br>
Omega 3:

<br>heart healthy, anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's, and basically save your life
<br>Don't even get broken down for energy usage cause they are so important and your brain and heart needs them.


<br>
Omega 6:

<br>Not good


<br>
Trans fats:

<br>Trans fats can't be broken down cause they have double bonds. So overtime they line arteries and the liver, cause chronic metabolic disease and insulin resistance.


<br>
Magarine lined your liver cause couldn't break transfats down

<br>
If olive oil is heated behond cooking point you create transfats

<br><br>
<br>We can leave galactose out of the equation because it basically becomes glucose.
<br><br>
<br>Glucose is basically the energy of life. Every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy. It's so important that if you don't consume it your body makes it (that's called gluconeogenesis)
<br>You need glucose for specific structural changes in proteins and hormones.
<br>Eating something containing glucose (like beagle) is not necessary a bad thing provided it's in your caloric requirements and it depends on how much you clear and how high the insulin spikes.
<br><br>
<br>Glucose is basically turned into uric acid which then is in the bloodstream and eventually needs to go out through the kidney.
<br>If uric acid doesn't go out it can inhibit mitochondrial function and also the enzyme that is there to lower your blood pressure. This leads to higher blood pressure.
<br><br>
<br>Fructose on the other hand is not needed for life and is like consumable poison. However, just like with alcohol, we have a limited capacity to process it.
<br>Fructose in nature always comes with glucose.
<br><br>
<br>First of all it can be addictive thus it can lead to overconsumption.
<br>But the main problem is that it inhibits 3 necessary enzymes needed for normal mitochondrial function. If the mitochondria works at peak efficiency that's metabolic health.
<br>The 3 enzymes are:

<br>AMP kinase: 

<br>Tells the liver to create new <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mitochondria" data-href="Mitochondria" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/mitochondria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">mitochondria</a> in the cell.
<br>Fructose basically locks that process without ever unlocking it.


<br>ACADL:

<br>They prepare fatty acid fot metabolism.


<br>CPT-1:

<br>Brings fatty acid from outer mitochondrial membrane to inner one so that there can be energy created out of it.




<br>Fructose is also addictive cause it stimulates the reward center.
<br><br>
<br>Fructose in fruits is not a concern cause it contains only little of it and its also mixed with fiber, the fiber in it mitigates it.
<br>Out of the fruits berries have the lowest amount fructose in them.
<br><br>
<br>The intestine will metabolism some of fructose actually 10% of the fructose will be turned into fat molecules (triglyceride) right away these then get into the blood stream. 
<br>The rest goes will go through the portal vein to the liver.
<br>Some of 
<br><br>
<br>Lactose has not much impact on insulin.
<br><br><br>
<br>The physical barrier is a mucin layer. If you won't feed your gut with bacteria it will feed of that mucin layer that's why fiber is so important.
<br><br>
<br>The intestine is basically a big sewer for junk and its job is to absorb the good stuff and put the rest out through the anus.
<br>The intestine is bound together with proteins which form the barrier, that proteins are called tight junction proteins. 
<br>If you change the nitrate status of that tight junction the intestine gets leaky that means that some of the junk goes through to your bloodstream this is a leaky gut.
<br>Fructose nitrates some of the tight junction that's why 93% of americans have leaky gut.
<br>Leaky gut can also lead to inflammation at the level of the liver. Which ultimately leads to systemic inflammation.
<br><br>
<br>By <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Intermitten Fasting" data-href="Intermitten Fasting" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/intermitten-fasting.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">intermitten fasting</a> you actually deplete the microbiome which leads to bacteria feeding of that mucin layer. But the caveat is that if you then it enough fiber and high quality <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fermented food" data-href="Fermented food" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/fermented-food.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">fermented food</a> (low sugar fermented) the gut microbiome gets replenished even better then it was before.
<br>Another reasons intermittent fasting is good is because you give the liver time to offload some of it's fat.
<br><br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fermented food" data-href="Fermented food" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/fermented-food.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fermented food</a> is good because of the short chain fatty acids.
<br>Basically the gut microbiome also turns fiber into short chain fatty acids.
<br><br>
<br>65% of what is ingested is used for resting energy expenditure, 10% goes thermic effective food (fat doesn't have any) and 25% goes to activity.
<br>When intake glucose you get a big glucose rise in bloodstream and insulin makes it go down. The higher the glucose goes the more insulin you need to bring it down.
<br>That glucose rise itself also isn't good and leads to health issues like problems with the arteries and kidney disease, because of change in blood pressure. Although the insulin response really makes it all bad.
<br>Insulin takes whatever you are not burning (blood glucose) and puts it into fat for storage this takes 90min
<br>If you are active within that 90 min then your muscles will take the glucose as immediate fuel and glycogen storage.
<br>These insulin spikes are one of biggest factors for metabolic disease.
<br><br>
<br>If you get insulin down you'll lose weight cause fat will give up its stored triglyceride as soon as insulin goes down.
<br>To get to low insulin need to get rid of refined carbohydrate, of sugar, increase the fiber, get rid of branch chain amino acids which are in corn feed meat and also in protein powder, if build muscle it's okay.
<br><br>
<br>There are 41 doublings of cells to turn the body into grown state of an adult 36 doublings. Overall an adult has 10 trillion cells.
<br>36 of these doublings happen pre natali (before birth) and 5 post natali (after birth). 
<br>A cell can eighter burn or grow, the signal for that is oxygen.
<br>This is cause oxygen is signals to the mitochondria to burn. In absence of oxygen the cell only knows to grow.
<br>Otto Warburg won the nobel prize for that same concept in discovering that in cancer cells.
<br>It's the insulin rise that drives the growth in the absence of oxygen. Otherwise when you have oxygen you don't need that much insulin cause you burn instead of store.
<br><br><br>
<br>Price elasticity is that if price of a good goes up that should lead to reduction in purchaser consumption because price influences consumption. 
<br>A example for this is eggs:

<br>When egg price goes up by 1% then consumption goes down 0.68% that means the difference so 0.32 is the price elasticity.


<br>The pendant to it is price inelasticity this means that when price goes up consumption stays the same.

<br>This is often seen in fast food, soft drinks, juice. That's because it contains lots of sugar which is consumers are addicted to.


<br><br>
<br>First there was the Keynesian economics model this is based on the concept of a rational actor, who can determine value thus utility over cost.
<br>In 1979 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="@Daniel Kahneman" data-href="@Daniel Kahneman" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/@Daniel Kahneman" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Daniel Kahneman</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="@Amos Tversky" data-href="@Amos Tversky" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/@Amos Tversky" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Amos Tversky</a> described the irrational actor. The irrational actor is one who can't determine value because he is risk averse thus the cost is always to great.
<br>Jeffrey Sachs described hedonic actor. The hedonic actor is one who also can't determine value cause it doesn't matter what it costs they need their fix. That's what's happening in the food industry right now.
<br><br>
<br>Sucrose is the sugar you know like cane sugar or beets sugar
<br>It consists of one molecule of glucose and one of fructose.

<br>Body separates them instantly and then glucose goes to entire body (insulin response) and the fructose goes straight to liver and generates fat.


<br>High fructose corn syrup is also 1 molecule of glucose one of fructose but they're not bound together.

<br>But they both do the same. The only difference is that high fructose corn syrup is easier to add to stuff cause it doesn't crystalize.


<br><br>
<br>The problem is that it is usually difficult to read anything from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Food labels" data-href="Food labels" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/food-labels.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">food labels</a>.
<br>Like sugar has over 262 names for it. So basically the only way to figure out if their is sugar in something is when you have a line for added sugars. 
<br>And you actually don't want anything higher then 4g of sugar per serving.
<br><br>
<br>There are 3 different fat depositories in the body and they all have there own limit. The fast cell itself is not the problem, the problem is that it can't handle the amount anymore.
<br>First one is subcutaneous fat:

<br>Big but fat
<br>If you gain 10kg of it you are metabolically ill. 
<br>This happens due to the fat cell not being able to handle the amount anymore and basically breaking down this then leads to release of cytokines which a pro inflammatory.
<br>This all then drains into the systemic circulation.


<br>Second is visceral fat:

<br>Big belly fat
<br>Only need 5kg fat to get metabolically ill.
<br>This now drains the cytokines through the portal vein direct to the liver.
<br>Actually the fat didn't come from calories it actually came through stress (cortisol).


<br>Third one is the liver:

<br>If you gain 1/4kg of it you are metabolically ill. 
<br>If you have fat in liver it causes metabolic disfunction right away.
<br>That fat comes from alcohol or sugar.


<br>Ranking of worst things for metabolic health:

<br>Alcohol and sugar
<br>Stress
<br>Subcutaneous fat which is least important for metabolic health.


<br><br>
<br>There is a categorization system of processed foods that can help choosing products this system is called Nova classes.
<br>Nova class 4 is the category with the problematic food so you should stay away from those. Anything that has more then 4 ingredients is nova class 4
<br>Nova class 1 is everything without a need for a food lable.
<br>The website <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://perfact.co:8443/Info/Info.html" target="_blank">https://perfact.co:8443/Info/Info.html</a> uses this filter to filter out products.
<br><br>
<br>Ultra processed food inhibits growth and hijacks growth of cancer.
<br>73% of food in grocery store is consumable poison.
<br><br>
<br>A lot of the already mentioned healthier dietary choices can help inflammation so getting rid of fructose, etc.
<br>Also you should get enough sleep cause sleep deprivation leads to increased inflammation due to increased cortisol.
<br>Emulsifiers can also create gut inflammation.
<br><br>
<br>Artificial sweeteners block leptin which is the hormone that tells brain you had enough.
<br>Therefore this makes us hungrier and and blocks the rewards for it.

<br>This is due to protection of <a data-href="neuron overstimulation" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/neuron overstimulation" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">neuron overstimulation</a> by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dopamin" data-href="Dopamin" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/dopamin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">dopamine</a>.

 <br><br>
<br>Salt = Sodium
<br>1g Table salt = 388mg sodium
<br><br>
<br>Little Clusters of Neurons that can sense salt. These sense the salt content in the bloodstream, in response it sets of certain events that make you eighter want to drink more or stop drinking.
<br>And when seeking water you not only seek water you also seek salt (sodium).
<br><br>
<br>Prevents certain substances to enter the brain, to protect itself from injury.
<br>Injury for the brain is especially bad cause it can't heal itself.

<br>Also a similar barrier in the testis and ovaries (Assumption there is protection of genetic material)


<br>The only molecules that have access to the brain are small and critical molecules.
<br>Some regions of brain have a weaker/stronger fence around then
<br><br>
<br>Osmotic thirst:

<br>Concentration of salt in bloodstream
<br>Vasopressin regulates Urin release


<br>Hypovolemic thirst:

<br>When drop in blood pressure.
<br>Causes are blood loss, Vomiting or diarrhea.


<br><br>
<br>There for release of substances (glucose, amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium)
<br>The kidney is like a knowledgeable filter and filters out things based on the body's demand.
<br>Urin basically is filtered blood.
<br>When we are thirsty the kidney gets told by the vasopressin to not release fluid, although when there is enough fluid its the other way around.
<br><br>
<br>Prevents fluid to go from kidney to bladder. Therefore its a anti diuretic.
<br><br>
<br>Adrenal glands make glucocorticoids (Also stress system) which effect the fluid balance and partly they do that by regulating craving and tolerance of salt we have
<br>Study with mice where removed adrenal glands and the mice where much more tolerant with the amount of sodium intake.
<br>It showed that low sodium = increased stress/anxiety
<br><br>
<br>For <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="magnesium" data-href="magnesium" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/magnesium" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Magnesium</a> there are lots of different forms
<br><a data-href="Potassium" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/Potassium" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Potassium</a> goes hand in hand with sodium (2:1 ratio recommended)
<br><br>
<br>For low carb diets you'll excrete more water and also lose sodium and potassium.
<br>The same goes for intermittent fasting.
<br><br>
<br>It's a diuretic (pee more)
<br>For every oz coffee/tea 1.5 more water
<br><br>
<br>
Depends on different Factors:

<br>level of blood pressure
<br>Diet
<br>fluid intake
<br>caffein
<br>electrolytes
<br>environment (hot/or cold which is dry)


<br>
2g up to 4.5-5g, More then 7g bad

<br>
Best to hear on craving but before that stop eating a processed diet.

<br>
For workouts you can use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Water > ^2b3f31" data-href="Water#^2b3f31" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/water.html#^2b3f31" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">galpin equation</a>.

<br>
From Book "The salt fix"

<br>3.2-4.8g sodium (8-12g salt per day)


<br><br>
<br>Basically neutralize each other and therefore its used in food industry to make you eat more
<br><br>
<br>Without sodium our neurons wouldn't function and we would be dead
<br>If drink to much too fast, thus you are deficient in sodium you'll die
<br>Also therefore if dehydrated you are often disoriented and confused

- Reduced inflammation<br>
- He also drinks it<br>
- If tap water already has high magnesium then he thinks you don't need to hydrogen enrich the water (although analyze the water and filter out byproducts)<br>
- To create hydrogen water is to purchase molecular hydrogen tablets which are basically magnesium tablets that resolve in water and create free hydrogen<br>
<br>Study that explains how it works
<br>Other magnesium tablets won't work

<br>Its beneficial for most people although if we really want to know if it could be beneficial for us then we should look at data thus <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blood work" data-href="Blood work" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/blood-work.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">blood work</a>. Based on that gathered data (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blood work" data-href="Blood work" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/blood-work.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">on glycemic profile</a>) you can then narrow the feeding window down.
<br>On average you should begin with a 12h feeding window and 12h fasting window.
<br><br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Fasting" data-href="How metabolism works#Fasting" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Fasting" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Intermitten fasting actually depletes the gut microbiome</a> for the time doing it that's why giving it some good food afterwards is important.
<br>More on that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Fasting" data-href="How metabolism works#Fasting" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Fasting" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">here</a>.
<br>But the body also eats waste components in the body (autophagy).
<br><br>
<br>Fasting was used in many civilizations as a way to detox the body. This also is in a lot of religions the case to cleanse the body from the bad.
<br>Some civilizations that used fasting include the romans, greeks and egyptens.
<br><br>
<br>There are also a lot of animals that use fasting.
<br><br>
<br>Basically we want to restrict our feeding window and push our breakfast back (12h eating window 12h fasting window).
<br>One rule of thumb can be to not eat and snack when you are not hungry.
<br>For the meals you usually want to add something fatty to it this helps with not being as hungry.
<br><br>
<br>It improves waste elimination, repair, detoxification and regeneration of cells (both fasting and caloric restriction have this effect).
<br>It also helps with fatty liver. In addition can also beneficial for treating <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dry &amp; Oily hair" data-href="Dry &amp; Oily hair" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/dry-&amp;-oily-hair.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">oily hair</a>.
<br>Also fasting and time restricted feeding improves metabolic health and overall longevity.

<br>Online guide: <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.theultimatehuman.com/guides" target="_blank">https://www.theultimatehuman.com/guides</a>
<br>3 day water fast:

<br>0-12h after last meal still digest some food and insulin still little high

<br>We want to be sensitive to insulin cause the less insulin it takes to regulate our blood sugar the longer we life.
<br>12-18h this is when fat burning begins

<br>Body goes into ketosis (fat burning)


<br>18-24h glucagon rises

<br>It counter acts the effect of insulin by stimulating the liver to turn stored glucose into sugars (gluconeogenesis).


<br>24-48h is when real magic happens

<br>waste elimination, repair, detoxification, cellular decision

<br>Is called the cleansing part (more clarity in mind)




<br>48-54h more magic happens

<br>Growth hormone is increased

<br>HGH is released to repair things




<br>54-72h is where insulin increases its sensitivity

<br>Authpaegy is highest there

<br>Stem cells get released in bloodstream and hunt around for damaged/inflamed tissue.








<br><br>
<br>Some of the side effects of fasting are keto fatigue, keto flu, cramps, thyroid symptoms.
<br>All that basically means you are sufficient in certain nutrients.

<br>Make sure to take B vitamins and electrolytes.

 <br><br><br>
<br>There are a many different wavelengths of light.

<br><img alt="LightWavelengths.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/lightwavelengths.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">


<br>White light has all of the wavelengths.
<br>There are also certain wavelengths we can't see like ultraviolet or infrared light.
<br><br>
<br>The biology of light means the conversion of light into signals for the body. This works cause light in its basic form is electromagnetic energy thus that energy can cause reaction in cells of plants, animals and humans.
<br><br>
<br>The different wavelengths can penetrate tissue of the body in different depths.
<br>Long wavelengths have the ability to penetrate through skin and potentially can even go down to the bone. 

<br>Red and infrared light


<br>On the other hand some shorter wavelengths won't easily penetrate tissues.

<br>Blue/green/ultraviolet light


<br><br>
<br>The different wavelengths of light are best absorbed by different <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Organelles" data-href="Organelles" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/organelles.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">organelles</a> within the cells. So their function can be stimulated by light.
<br>This is due to certain pigments/colors in the receiver of light energy that then absorb/reflect the different wavelengths of light.
<br>So we have eighter a absorption/reflection or passing through of light.
<br><br><br>
<br>The eyes have photoreceptors on back of it, there are actually two types rods and cones. They both have photo pigments in them.
<br>Rods:

<br>The rods absorb any wavelength of light. In addition they are used in low light conditions.


<br>Cones:

<br>With cones there are 3 types red/green/blue so they can eighter absorb long/mid/short wavelengths of light. They have different photo pigments for that.


<br><br>
<br>The other place we can use to utilize light is the skin, it's pigment is called melanin. 
<br>On the top layer of skin we have keratinocytes and melanocytes. The melanocytes create the pigmentation of skin, the way they do it is by absorption of UV light.
<br><br>
<br>
Actually every cell of the body, provided the light can access them can be changed by it in positive or negative ways.

<br>
For the cells that can't get the light directly they'll get it indirectly through the eyes or the skin.

<br>
Basically all starts with absorption of the light through particular pigments of the surfaces the light lands on.

<br><br>
<br>Light can affect our biology eighter in fast/moderately or in slow ways.
<br>A fast effect would be releasing adrenaline when moving from dark to very bright environment.
<br>A slow integrating effect would be the average light information over a day or over the entire year.
<br>Also our hormones that are effected by that.
<br><br>
<br>In our eye we have a particular cell type called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells, they communicate to specific stations in brain which connect to the pineal gland. The pineal gland is there for the production of melatonin.
<br>When light is absorbed by the ganglion cells this shuts down the production of melatonin by the pineal gland.
<br><br>
<br>Regulatory effects:

<br>Positiv impact on bone mass
<br>Maturation of gonads during puberty, overview/testes (lowers amount of sperm, that's why you young kids have high melatonin to not get into puberty)
<br>Also involved in placental evolvement
<br>Powerful impact on central nervous system
<br>Effects on waking up and feeling sleepy        


<br>Protective effects:

<br>Can activate the immune system (one of the most potent anti oxidants, anti cancer properties)


<br>It's the rise and fall of melatonin and duration of melatonin signal that gives these effects.
<br><br>
<br>There are normal changes in melatonin release during the year, that's cause you'll get more/less light (sunlight) each day on average, depending on where you are located. This happens due to the fact that the earth travels around the sun.
<br>In winter (short days) little light on average is landing on the body's cells so duration of melatonin release is much longer.
<br>In summer (long days) more light on average is landing on the body's cells so duration of melatonin release is much shorter.
<br>Therefore in summer months you want more sunlight in your eyes and in winter it can be less, the exception is if you have bad mode in winter.
<br>If you have depression in the winter months (seasonal affective disorder) it can be beneficial to go outside or to use a bright artificial light source like the Sad lamps.
<br>And even on cloudy days you'll get more light then from normal artificial light.
<br><br>
<br>Get proper amount of sunlight each day. The proper amount depends on the time of the year.
<br><br>
<br>Melatonin supplements aren't good cause they have a static effect, meaning it has a full impact right away. Normally melatonin increases dynamically.
<br>Also most of the melatonin supplements have to much melatonin in them.
<br><br>
<br>If getting up in the middle of the night, for example to go to the toilet, you shouldn't use bright light , this will destroy your melatonin thus your sleep.
<br>The trick to bypass this is to eighter dim lights or use longer wavelengths of light (won't impact receptors that impact melatonin).

<br>Therefore use Amber colored light or red light.
<br>But be aware that any light that's bright enough will shut down melatonin production.


<br><br>
<br>Sleeping 1 night in a moderately light environment can cause increase in night time heart rate, decrease in heart rate variability and increase in insulin resistance on the next morning.
<br><br>
<br>The mating behavior is increased in the long days of spring/summer for animals as well as humans.
<br><br>
<br>First one is due to melatonin which can inhibit testosterone and estrogen output from the testes and ovaries.
<br>The second pathway, actually a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Parallel pathway" data-href="Parallel pathway" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/Parallel pathway" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">parallel pathway</a>, is more like an accelerator. It can trigger increase in testosterone and estrogen and desire to mate by exposure to UVB (UV blue light) to the skin, not eyes. 

<br>This is cause the skin can be a hormone producing or influencing organ.


<br>So a protocol for that could be light exposure for 20-30 minutes, in the middle of the day for 2-3 times a week.
<br>Through that we can also see seasonal changes in testosteron, with in the winter it being its lowest and in summer its highest.
<br><br>
<br>The UVB light can also effect out pain tolerance.
<br>That also means due to the changing amount of sun exposure over the year our pain tolerance also changes.
<br>This improved pain tolerance comes from light landing on the eyes and being absorbed, then they signal areas of brain to release endogenous opioids, these lead to a lower perception of pain.
<br>So its beneficial for people with chronic pain to expose there selves with sun light.
<br><br>
<br>Sunlight exposure to eyes can increase mood.
<br><br>
<br>When UVB hits our eyes it triggers the activation of the neurons in the sympathetic nervous system (part of autonomic nervous system).
<br>When enough UVB hit the eyes, a specific channel in sympathetic nervous system is activated. The spleen then deploys immune cells/molecules that combat infection.
<br><br>
<br>Infrared and red light has the advantage that it can pass down to deeper layers of skin where it can change the metabolic function of different cells.
<br>Shining red light on skin can renew skin cells by first burning off the first layer of skin slightly and then triggering certain biological pathways that then promote growth of new skin cells.
<br><br>
<br>Red light therapy can help with treatment of acne, reduction in skin lesions, wound healing, reduction in scars. It also helps with age related vision loss. (beneficial for people older then )
<br><br>
<br>If you wear sunglasses you will reflect the sun thus not getting the benefit of it. 
<br>For the same reason you shouldn't wear blue light blockers at daytime. They can be beneficial in the nighttime.

 <br><br>
<br>
Saturated fat which is typically solid at room temperature.

<br>
Unsaturated fat which is typically liquid at room temperature.

<br>Unsaturated fats can be further divided.
<br>Mono unsaturated fats
<br>Polyunsaturated fats

<br>Omega 3
<br>Omega 6




<br>
<img alt="SaturatedUnsaturatedFats.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/saturatedunsaturatedfats.png" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">

<br><br>
<br>Most tissues contain of saturated fat and mono unsaturated fat, that's why we have a increased intake need for those both.
<br>Polyunsaturated fats are not that highly required but omega 3 is a very good one though.
<br><br>
<br>100 years ago the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio was around 4:1 or even less. Today we have a average ratio of 20:1 omega-6 to omega-3.
<br>But some of the oils have even higher ratios like corn with 60:1 and safflower oil 77:1.
<br>So the ratio should be as little as possible ideally as close to 1:1 ratio.
<br><br>
<br>Both Omega-3 and Omega-6 are polyunsaturated fats. 
<br>And they compete for the enzyme (desaturase) to get broken down, this is the real problem cause if you already are loaded up with omega 6 then you can't utilize that much of the omega 3.
<br>That's why the omega 6 to omega3 ratio is important.
<br>Also a increase in the omega-6/3 ratio has shown the rise in numerous autoimmune, inflammatory, allergic diseases and all sorts of other health issues.
<br><br>
<br>Omega 6 is not as highly required as omega 3 although it has its right to exist.
<br>Not all of the omega 6 is inflammatory but most of it is.
<br><br>
<br>One of the main problems is the of it and especially the high amounts of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6 > Linoleic acid" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6#Linoleic acid" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html#Linoleic_acid" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">linoleic acid</a> (LA) which is primarily in plant based oils.
<br>The omega 6 fatty acids are also easily oxidized which can cause free radicals to damage the cell membranes and also damage to the mitochondria. 
<br>Oxidized fats get also trapped in cell membrane and can cause inflammation and poor cellular function.
<br><br><br>
<br>Actually in the 18 hundreds machines where lubricated with synthetic seed oil.
<br><br>
<br>When seed oils oxidate its also linked to poor immune system function and increased insulin resistance.
<br>Especially contain higher amounts of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Omega 3 vs Omega 6 > Linoleic acid" data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6#Linoleic acid" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html#Linoleic_acid" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">linoleic acid</a>.
<br><br>
<br>For the production of seed oil the food industry often uses chemicals for different purposes. One of the chemicals would be hexane. 
<br>Furthermore they often use GMO based plants to make the oil.
<br>Also to process involves the heating of the oils to high temperature which actually turns them rancid. When you heat them often they also become trans and hydrogenated fats which then release oxidized free radicals into our body.
<br>Sometimes they are even deodorized with sodium hydroxide, carcinogen hexane (known neurotoxin).
<br><br>
<br>The overconsumption of linoleic acid is pro-inflammatory, pro-allergic, pro-thrombotic state.
<br>Its also contained in corn fed animal products. But in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed" data-href="Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/grass-fed-vs.-grain-fed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">grass fed</a> animal products it is reduced significantly.
<br>The linoleic acid from the seed oil makes the skin more susceptible to damage of the sun thus higher risk of skin cancer. 
<br><br>
<br>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats that means the body can't produce them in its own.
<br><br>
<br>There are basically 3 types of omega-3 sources:

<br>ALA (alpha linoleic acid): 

<br>Primarily in vegetables. Also butter, ghee have it.


<br>EPA

<br>Only in marine life and some in meat.


<br>DHA

<br>Only in marine life/algae and some in meat.




<br>Egg yolks have all 3 of the types.
<br><br>
<br>The ALA type is converted into DHA and EPA but that conversion is not that efficient. The conversion only results in 6% of EPA and 4% DHA.  

<br>Its also depended on the person some can convert it little better but most won't.


<br>And its even harder to convert plant oil into the two.
<br><br>
<br>In general omega 3 has lots of health benefits. From which a big one is overall decreases in inflammation.
<br>Observations have shown that higher omega-3 intake can lower risk of asthma, eczema and atopic wheeze.
<br>Also omega 3 favors the growth of short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria.
<br>Both EPA and DHA also have phosphatidylcholine which protects the cell membrane, this is actually needed for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How salt impacts our body > Sodium and Neural function" data-href="How salt impacts our body#Sodium and Neural function" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-salt-impacts-our-body.html#Sodium_and_Neural_function" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">cellular communication</a> (Sodium Potassium Pump)
<br><br>
<br>DHA is very healthy for the eyes, function of ears, brain function and heart health.
<br>But that aren't the only effects it decreases blood triglycerides, helps with inflammation, helps with muscle recovery, lowers blood pressure and even protects <a data-href="telomeres" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/telomeres" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">telomeres</a>. So it overall decreases mortality.
<br>Its also very beneficial and essential for toddlers.
<br><br>
<br>EPA also has lot of health benefits. It can reduces cellular inflammation also decreases neuro inflammation (it's what causes dementia), it's good for the cardiovascular system and also helps with burning excess fat.
<br><br>
<br>DHA is one of the components that is beneficial during pregnancy.
<br>Studies have shown that Omega-3s in pregnancy reduce allergic disease in offspring.
<br><br>
<br>LA is linoleic acid (omega 6)

<br>Increases inflammation
<br>It is bad.


<br>ALA is alpha linoleic acid (omega 3)

<br>Decreases inflammation
<br>It is not bad.


<br><br>
<br>Basically almost all seed oils beside extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil is bad to consume.
<br>Also you should avoid dressings that contain seed oils.
<br><br>
<br>Tallow
<br>Butter
<br>Ghee
<br>Coconut oil
<br>Extra virgin olive oil

<br>Best is brand from Italy and cold pressed

<br>You need to look at label and see if it is diluted with other seed oils, if so don't buy them.




<br>Nuts that are low in linoleic acid:

<br>Macadamias
<br>Cashew
<br>Pistachios
<br>hazelnuts


<br>Fish

<br>If you eat fish eat wild caught one
<br>Problem with fish is that it often contains heavy metals.


<br>Meat
<br>**ALL of the animal products should be from grass fed (grass finished) animals.**<br>
Why here: <a data-href="Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/grass-fed-vs.-grain-fed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grass Fed vs. Grain Fed</a><br><br>
<br>Periodization index gives info when oil is damaged
<br><br>
<br>Tallow
<br>Butter
<br>Ghee
<br>Coconut oil
<br><br>
<br>Won't denature when heated
<br>Not oxidize or get rancid when heated
<br><br>
<br>Don't want to heat olive and avocado oil.
<br>Olive oil when heated can create trans fats.

Inexpensive fish oil is often very low quality so he wouldn't consume it

<br>
Virgin cod liver oil is better

<br>
Larger fish are higher in mercury

<br>
The more selenium the less mercury effect in body

<br>
Wheatgrass (kamut) juice has also a lot selenium (supports enzymes for detoxification in liver)

<br>

<br>Fish oil often gets bad fast


<br>
Better source is krill oil (fish similar to shrimp, won't turn bad that fast)<br>

<br><br>
<br>Based on mouths pH, thus being acidic or basic, it is either in a demineralization (de min) or remineralization (re min) state. 
<br>The pH of the mouth largely depends on how much salvia you produce and how mineralized it is.
<br>If the pH is right, thus not acidic, the bad bacteria will be killed off.
<br>So our foods pH effects the mouths pH.  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Oral Health > ^7bf097" data-href="Oral Health#^7bf097" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/oral-health.html#^7bf097" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">More on that here.</a>
<br><br>
<br>Saliva production isn't always the same all day long. There are certain times when there is more and less production.
<br>In the times where we have more production we have optimal opportunity to have the right pH.
<br>We have the most production in the morning and during the middle of the day. And have the least amount of production during night time.
<br>But what can disrupt this production is eating. Thus time restricted eating (intermitted fasting) can be beneficial.
<br>Based on the reduced production in the night, brushing before going to bed, to remove food particles that potentially can feed the bad bacteria, becomes crucial. Cause we don't have much salvia that can mitigate the bacteria feeding on the food.
<br><br>
<br>It's happening in enamel and dentin layer.
<br>Through minerals (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Oral Health > Hydroxyapatite" data-href="Oral Health#Hydroxyapatite" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/oral-health.html#Hydroxyapatite" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hydroxyapatite</a>) it forms a robust chain of crystals. These bonds are very strong and protect the tooth. But the acid of the cavities bacteria can break these bonds, if we are in a demineralized state.
<br>We can solve cavities, if its not already in deeper layers (dentin layer).
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Fluoride uses a similar approach to a humans normal remineralization process, it also creates these bonds to protect the teeth, but they are much more stronger. Infect Hyperstrong. 
<br><br>
<br>
Cavities is not caused by any food nor by sugar.

<br>
It forms by bacteria (streptococcus mutants), we receive them like a infection. So we aren't born with it.

<br>
Strep mutants primary feed on sugar, thus also carbs, but if you starve them from sugar they'll also feed on other stuff.

<br>
What creates cavities: 

<br>The bacteria creates a acid that then creates holes from outside to inside of the tooth and demineralizes it. The more demineralization we have the faster the cavities can move forward.


<br>
Knowing that our goal is to ensure a remineralized state of the tooth.

<br>
Although the key point is this: 

<br>The degree to which mouth is in de min or re min state and the degree to which cavities has the opportunity to form is dependent on the amount of time the mouth is net acidic/alkaline. (No one can avoid the mouth being acidic once in a while)

<br><br>
<br>Alcohol:

<br>disrupts oral microbiome, demineralizes


<br>Stimulants:

<br>Everything that contains epinephrin and norepinephrine
<br>Changes pH of mouth
<br>Promotes mouth breathing


<br>Mouth breathing:

<br>More bacteria can get into the mouth


<br>Smoking
<br>Sugar:

<br>if eat it then rinse/brush after it


<br>Mouth wash
<br>Left food particles
<br>Acidic food:

<br>rinse/brush after it
<br>Limit time they are in your mouth


<br><br>
<br>The gum (gingiva) protects the teeth and keeps them stable.
<br>If bacteria gets through the gum it can lead to periodontal disease which ultimately leads to Alzheimer's disease.
<br>By tooth health you also support gum health.
<br><br><br>
<br>Main goal break biofilm layer created by the bad bacteria (Step mutants).
<br>First its plaque and when it gets hard its tatar (yellow tint). Usually tatar needs to be scrubed off by a dentist.
<br>Dentist polish the teeth cause then it's harder for bacteria to stay on that smooth surface.
<br><br>
<br>The main goal is to get food particles out of the spaces between the teeth.
<br><br>
<br>Different locations in mouth have different microbiome with good and bad bacteria so does the tongue have one.
<br>We want to get rid of the bad bacteria there too.
<br>But for perfect oral health view this guide: <a data-href="Tool - Toothcare Routine" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/tools/tool-toothcare-routine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tool - Toothcare Routine</a><br><br>
<br>The deplete certain things and disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbiome.
<br>They contain alcohol which itself is not good for the mouth.
<br>Alcohol based mouthwashes also reduce nitric oxide produced in oral cavity.
<br>Nitric oxide is important cause it promotes vasodilation (when nasal breath, when oral microbiome is healthy we improve it)

<br>It's good for arterial and capillary health


<br><br><br>
<br>
It's a low calorie sweetener

<br>
bad bacteria feed on it instead of the other food. It then prevents step mutants from creating acid, and also kills some of them.

<br>
It also reduces inflammation of the gum tissues and other inflammation in the mouth.

<br>
There is also some evidence that it benefits the gut microbiome.

<br>
So there are xylitol gums (1-2 after meal)

<br>Also increases production of saliva

<br>Before getting a filling ask the dentist if remineralizing the tooth still would help (that works when caveties is not to deep).
<br>Metal fillings (Ones out of lead are bad, many metal fillings also contain mercury)

<br>Do try to not disrupt those mercury ones avoid mastic gum (thick gum) or hard candy.


<br><br>
<br>We can improve or heal it. We can do that by utilizing the link between the oral and gut microbiome.

 <br><br>
<br>Water in the cells gets incorporated through different proteins, organelles.
<br>Many of the processes involve the bonding or lack of bonding with water molecules and proteins
<br>Reactive oxygen species (or free radicals, anti oxidants, all that really describes the presents or absents of charges that are bound or unbound)
<br>Free radicals can damage cells because they are free electrons. If they are free they can bind to cells and change them causing the damage.
<br>Cells deal with those free radicals through anti oxidants 
<br>Antioxidants are molecules that can be in different forms (sometimes vitamins). They bind up free radicals or repair bonds between cells so that the cells don't have the bad influence anymore.
<br>There is no disease that doesn't have reactive oxygen species involved
<br>Also no benefit into antioxidant interference getting in the way of the oxidative process
<br>All learned so far is organic chemistry
<br>Water can act as antioxidant if it bonds to things in proper way which requires it to go into cells in the right amount and rate therefore the temperature and ph must be correct
<br>Also there needs to be enough water and it shouldn't contain things that are damaging
<br>Potentially carring good things in it potassium, sodium
<br>When water is inside cells then it can interact and change conformation of different proteins and exelerate or slow down different cellular reactions
<br>Water can effect disease, health, repair of different cells

 <br><br><br>
<br>The best is to get as much protein out of your normal diet as possible. But when working out its fine to use protein powder.
<br><br>
<br>In general animal proteins have a better digestibility and utilization over plant ones.
<br>Also protein from plant sources often lack or have smaller amounts of amino acids.
<br>Plant based ones also have bigger amounts of heavy metals

<br>70% of all plant based ones have it in them


<br>But be aware also low quality animal ones can also contain heavy metals.
<br>But the worst protein by far is soy protein

<br>It can lower androgen receptor density which testosteron actually needs to bind.

<br>This protein is also contained in tofu.




<br><br>
<br>There are 3 types with animal protein. There is beef, whey and egg protein.
<br>In general all of the 3 have the same same bioavailability, but they have some small differences:

<br>Whey is higher in amino acid cysteine (increases glutathione)

<br>Beef protein higher in glycine (also in creating glutathione involved but also collagen)




<br>So the two are better then the egg one.
<br>When looking for a protein powder always look for the COA testing (company tests for heavy metals and PPA)

<br>PPA is a androgen disrupting compound.


<br><br>
<br>The difference in it is basically that the isolate just has the protein in it and the other also has different other nutrients in it. So basically isolate is the filtered version.
<br>Also in a concentrate you'll have lactose in it.
<br><br>
<br>Meat (If you eat more <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lean Meat" data-href="Lean Meat" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/lean-meat.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">lean meat</a> then you should consider looking at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lean Meat" data-href="Lean Meat" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/lean-meat.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">this</a>.)

 <br><br>
<br>We are very photovoltaic beings
<br><br>
<br>It has effects on:

<br>Reducing inflammation (also in brain)
<br>increasing microvascular circulation 
<br>benefiting the immune system
<br>good for wound healing (therefore good for post surgical repair)
<br>beneficial for the lungs and the spinal chord
<br>It has also been shown that red light therapy before exercise can improve recovery.
<br>Anti depressant effects
<br>improved collagen elastin/fibrin
<br>hair follicle restauration, thickening them and allowing to get more nutrients to the roots.
<br>positive effects on Parkinson
<br>Also 15min of red light can reduce blood glucose levels


<br><br>
<br>Usually red light panels are very expensive especially the good ones. 
<br>When buying one though its important to have one that is able to hit certain wavelengths to get the full benefits. Because different nanometers of light have different effects on the body.

<br>It should have the 680-720 nanometers, and specifically should have the 810 and 940 nanometer one.


<br><br>
<br>Certain wavelengths of red light are even able to go down to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mitochondria" data-href="Mitochondria" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/mitochondria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">mitochondria</a>.
<br>This then kicks out mitochondrial nitic oxide and lets oxygen instead dock to it. This docking of oxygen leads to 16 times more efficiency in creating energy. 
<br>This overall is a very beneficial thing.
<br>Would also see the effect with nitric oxide test strips when you put them in the mouth.
<br><br>
<br>You also can get some of the benefits of it by sunlight. Furthermore <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sunlight" data-href="Sunlight" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/sunlight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">sunlight exposure</a> in general is a very beneficial thing.
<br><br>
<br>If you use red light therapy then use it for minimum 10 minutes and if you are able to then 20 minutes.
<br>Also alternatively some gyms or spas offer red light therapies.

In nature lot of plants contain little caffeine, so little that you won't notice it, or they have more prominent other flavors.

<br>
Especially flowers use this, and that acts as a reinforcer for bees to go to that flowers and prefer those.

<br><br>
<br>Reinforcer:

<br>A reinforcer makes us feel slightly or a lot better.


<br>Aversive:

<br>If something contains a aversive and we feel off with a thing, then the probability of drinking/eating the same thing again is lower, or if its strong enough you won't even like the environment anymore.
<br>It makes us feel worse.

<br>
We on average spent 25 years of our life sleeping.

<br>
People who sleep 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 tend to live the longest

<br>
Average person needs 10-15min to fall asleep (if just in under 5min then you probably where sleep deprived)

<br>
Blue light reduces the production of melatonin

<br>Also reduces the amount of time in rem phase, which is needed for cognitive function


<br>
Before bed dim light

<br><br>
<br>Don't use your bedroom as your work room.
<br><br>
<br>It's important to have a night time routine that can help you wind down and prepare for sleep. It also acts as a signal to the brain. This goes hand in hand with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sleep > Making your bed to your sanctuary" data-href="Sleep#Making your bed to your sanctuary" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/sleep.html#Making_your_bed_to_your_sanctuary" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">making your bed to your sanctuary</a>.
<br>Good habits for night routines are:

<br>Bed time tea

<br>Warm baths
<br>Stretching
<br>Breathing exercise (Best to use is box breathing it brings you in a relaxed state)
<br>Journaling to get your thoughts out




<br><br>
<br>12h before sleep no caffein
<br>3h before sleep no food or alcohol
<br>2h before sleep no more work
<br>1h before sleep no screen time
<br>0 times hitting the snooze button

<br>That extra minute won't help you and will rather have a negative effect on you.


<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Sleep deprivation leads to the body's functions being disrupted.
<br>Has negative effects on gut and oral microbiome.

 <br><br>
<br>Most normal sunscreens contain seed oils.

<br><br><br>
<br>The linoleic acid from the seed oil makes the skin more susceptible to damage of the sun thus higher risk of skin cancer. 

<br>There is also oxybenzone/octocrylene/avobenzone in them which is linked to cancer.


<br><br>
<br>All the ingredients are not comedogenic meaning they don't cause pores to clog up. In addition the ingredients are all natural so you could even it them.
<br><br>
<br>This is the natural ingredient that can protect from UVB and UVA.
<br><br>
<br>2tbs bee wax
<br>1/2 cup coconut oil
<br>1/2 cup of tallow
<br>Melts those 3 then add the zinc
<br>Then put it away from heat and stir it
<br>To make it more tinted you can add cacao in there
<br><br>
<br>I wanted to try if it really is that effective so I started a little experiment. 
<br>There are 3 stripes one is sun exposure without protection, one is with regular sun screen and one is with the homemade one.

 <br><br>Before ever starting to really optimize your nutrition you should understand the basic problems we are fighting against.<br>
This is best done by understanding of how the body works: <a data-href="How metabolism works" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">How metabolism works</a>.<br>With that knowledge you can then decide what diet you want to chose and what suits you best.<br>
Also its key to always listen to your body and also get data (blood work) to see the differences. <br>There is no such thing as one size fits all, every human is individual.<br><br>These are the types of foods that every individual should cut out.<br>
<br>Ultra processed food with carbohydrates

<br>Not every carb is the similar. Pasta is not berry.
<br>The problem with it is not the carb itself its the high insulin spike that comes with it.
<br>Go here to find out more: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Carbohydrates" data-href="How metabolism works#Carbohydrates" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Carbohydrates" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Carbohydrates</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Insulin and its effects" data-href="How metabolism works#Insulin and its effects" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Insulin_and_its_effects" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Insulin</a>


<br>Sugar and added sugar

<br>It's basically consumable poison. The body doesn't need sugar (fructose, sucrose).
<br>However it is strongly used by the food industry to make you addicted to their products.
<br>Go here to find out more: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="How metabolism works > Fructose" data-href="How metabolism works#Fructose" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/how-metabolism-works.html#Fructose" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fructose</a>


<br>Omega 3 vs omega 6 ratio being disrupted 

<br>Our omega 3 to omega 6 ratio inflated drastically over the last hundred years. We are at a ratio of 20:1 (omega 6 to omega 3) but actually should be near to 1:1.
<br>Go here to find out more: <a data-href="Omega 3 vs Omega 6" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/omega-3-vs-omega-6.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Omega 3 vs Omega 6</a>


<br>Seed oils:

<br>Basically the reason why omega 6 to omega 3 is disrupted is basically due to seed oils. 
<br>They also contain linoleic acid which is also bad for the human body.
<br>Furthermore they also often undergo multiple chemical processes when being made.

 <br><br>
<br>Our ancestors usually not ate any vegetables except they where starving.
<br>So it was more like a fallback food for them
<br><br>
<br>The issue with vegetables is that most vegetables contain <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Anti Nutrients" data-href="Anti Nutrients" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/anti-nutrients.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">anti nutrients</a> which inhibit the absorption of good nutrients. And also some vegetables can cause inflammation.
<br>Often symptoms of not being able to really handle vegetables are gut issues and autoimmune disease.
<br>With vegetables it really depends on how you thrive with them, if you thrive then you can use them if not then cut them out.
<br>Also some vegetables accumulate a lot of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Heavy metals" data-href="Heavy metals" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/Heavy metals" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">heavy metals</a> when grown in soil that has heavy metals in it.
<br>Also you could get the same nutrients in better and higher amount from meat/organ meat/<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fruits" data-href="Fruits" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/fruits.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">fruits</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="All about dairy" data-href="All about dairy" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/all-about-dairy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">raw dairy</a>.
<br><br>
<br>Some studies suggest that vegetable fiber isn't actually that effective for gut health.
<br>Some studies show there is no change in alpha diversity. So it doesn't have big impact on <a data-href="|microbiome" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/|microbiome" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">|microbiome</a> diversity
<br>Although high fermented foods had increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers.

 <br><br>
<br>H2O is polarized that means it has a negative charge on the oxygen and a positiv one one the two hydrogen.
<br>Positiv and negative connect.
<br><img alt="WaterChemistry.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/waterchemistry.png">
<br>The different arrangement of water molecules is highly depended on Temperature.
<br><br>
<br>3 of water (liquid, gas, solid)
<br>Other then other things water is less dense in it's solid state, that why ice is able to float. If that wouldn't be so then life probably wouldn't exist.
<br>It's cause there is a very thin layer on the water surface that is more dense. 
<br><br>
<br>The 4th state is called structured water
<br>In presence of certain solids/liquids the water molecules can change, so that the positive molecules attract one another.
<br>These bonds are not as strong as water in it's solid state.
<br>Example of structured water is water being like a bubble on a glass surface or water sticking to a car window when it rains.
<br><br>
<br>Water is one of the best dissolvents, its even better then acid.
<br>The substances that are hydrophilic, that means they have a tendency to mix with water.
<br>On the other hand Lipids (oils) won't easily dissolve cause they are hydrophobic, so they have tendency to repel from water.
<br><br>
<br>Every cell in our body needs water.
<br>We can get water through drinking and also through inhaling humid air.
<br>The water moves from the stomach to the bloodstream and finally to the cells.
<br><br>
<br>There are two ways water can access cells:

<br>First way is diffusion: 

<br>The outside of most cells is out of lipid (fat), water and that lipid alter just so that they can connect and the water can be dissolved, this is the slow approach.
<br>Second way is by aquaporin channels: 

<br>This are portables through the membrane where the molecules can pass through (1 million water molecules per second), the inside of those channels is very hydrophobic (water repulsive). This is the faster approach.


<br><img alt="Aquaporin.png" src="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/lib/media/aquaporin.png" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">




<br>The reason of two ways is that there are certain tissues that need to take or release water more often and also very quickly (tear glands, gut). 
<br>But most cells have these channels, only ones not having them are bones and ligaments.
<br><br>
<br>Temperature and pH can heavily effect the movement of water through this aquaporin channels thus the absorption of water.
<br><br>
<br>The pH of water has impact on how good we can absorb and utilities water.
<br>The more alkalin (pH&gt;7.4) water can be absorbed more quickly. But we don't necessarily need high pH water to hydrate the body well.
<br><br>
<br>A big myth is that the pH of water directly affects the pH of body is wrong. It only changes the absorption rate of the cell.
<br><br>
<br>Hard water contains more magnesium and calcium this effects the pH of it, the higher the concentration of those two the higher pH.
<br>This higher pH therefore better absorption of water has positive effects on cardiovascular health.
<br><br>
<br>Temperature affects rate of absorption and impact on cells/tissues/organs.
<br>Cold water will resort in a slower to absorbtion.
<br>Can by temperature or filtering of water can affect the rate of absorption of water in the gut.
<br>This will reduce inflammation and also makes sure you get proper hydration of different cell types in the body.
<br><br>
<br>The pH of the body itself (pH of cells at different locations) is pretty stable and doesn't change that much. The process for that regulation is Homeostatic regulation.
<br>Although some cells can have different pH, for example the gut has a very different pH.
<br><br><br>
<br>For every hour awake in the first 10h of the day you should consume on average 8oz (240ml) of fluid. So total amount would be 2.4 liters in the first 10h.
<br>We take the 10h in consideration cause that's when the kidney is mostly active, in the nighttime it downregulates its function.
<br><br>
<br>The galpin formular is used when exercising:

<br>bodyweight in pound/30 = number of oz fluid to ingest every 15-20min on average while exercise


<br>In metric system:

<br>2ml per kg bodyweight every 15-20min


<br><br>
<br>Exercising in hot environment:

<br>Double galpin formular.


<br>Sauna:

<br>Double baseline intake (16oz).


<br>If feeling dehydrated

<br>Then you can drink more like 16oz per hour while feeling dehydrated.
<br>Avoid diuretics (increased fluid excretion)


<br><br>
<br>Thirst is a reasonable guide for when we are dehydrated but it doesn't really keep up with our bodies level of dehydration.
<br><br>
<br>Water can act as antioxidant if it bonds to things in proper way. Which requires right amount and rate of absorption of water to the cell therefore the temperature and pH must be correct.
<br>Through that water can effect disease, health, repair of different cells.
<br><br>
<br>Fluid intake elevates alertness it's due to the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system that's the aspect that makes you more alert.
<br>When we have fluid in gut, cells are well hydrated and our bladder contains fluid there is a elevated activation of the sympathetic nervous system by two pathways:

<br>Mechanical: 

<br>Sense stretching of tissue in gut and bladder.
<br>Chemical level:

<br>Sends info to areas of brain associated with sympathetic arousal which makes us more alert, that's what wakes us up from sleep if we need to pee.






<br>This alertness also translates to enhanced cognitive/physical function.
<br><br>
<br>The process of filtration of fluids in the body is highly depended on the body's circadian cycle depend.

<br>Especially kidney and the gut are strongly influenced by it.
<br>That's why the kidney is most active in the first 10h after waking.


<br>In addition the rate of filtration of through the kidney doesn't depend on the volume ingested but on the rate of ingestion. Thus drinking faster, faster excresion.
<br><br>
<br>
DBP's in water:

<br>DPB's (disinfection byproduct) are byproducts of chemicals used to disinfect water in water treatment facilities.
<br>These byproducts strongly effect the pH of water by changing the concentration of magnesium and calcium.
<br>They also can cause endogene disruption which is not good for reproduktiv health.


<br>
Flouride:

<br>Fluoride is also in tap water and is not really beneficial for our health.
<br>If you have the possibility to check the concentration of it in your area then check it.

<br>Google water analysis and zip code




<br>
Other sources for disruptions are the pipes and the faucet mash.

<br><br>
<br>Distilled and double distilled water:

<br>In that process also magnesium and calcium is removed so that's not good. Therefore it's better to not drink it.


<br>Reverse osmosis:

<br>Is a good way of filtering water it also still contains magnesium and other minerals, although it decreases them.


<br>Deuterium depleted water:

<br>Water near sea level has more deuterium in them.
<br>Deuterium means the enrichment or lack of hydrogen in the water.


<br>Electrolyte reduced water/hydrogen rich water/hydrogen enriched water/deuterium depleted water all have the property of having higher pH then other forms of water.

 <br>Boiling water will not help with the containment cause some are made even worse through it<br><br>
<br>
Look for water filtration system best would be reverse osmosis

<br>
At least get chlorine and fluoride out of water

<br>
After its been under reverse osmosis add minerals back in water (Celtic salt)

<br>
He does hydrogen water after the reverse osmosis

<br>
There is all sorts of flouride free toothpaste

<br>
If have the money for filtering system stage 4 one get one and add back minerals with baja gold sea salt salt or Celtic salt to remineralize the water

<br>

<br>It's hard to filter out fluoride without reverse osmosis


<br>
Also with showering it's not good

 <br>
<br>So the aim of this study is to assess the effect of cow ghee on memory and lipid profile
<br>Cow ghee and butter group showed no significant effect on memory in EPM and MWM model. There was reduction in weight of animals in Cow Ghee group and increase in weight with Butter
<br>The result of experiment suggests that no beneficial effect cow ghee and butter on cognition was seen. However, ghee is relatively safer when compared to Butter in considering lipid profile.
<br>However, there is a lack of scientific data regarding the effect of Cow Ghee on learning and memory.
<br>Amongst all edible fats it is found that nutrition composition of cow ghee and butter is comparatively similar. The total content of fat (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and cholesterol) is nearly the same [10] hence, we decide to take butter as a comparator arm and compare the effect of cow ghee and butter on memory and lipid profile.
<br>There has been concern about the possibility of ghee contributing to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to its high percentage of saturated fatty acids, leading to increased synthesis of cholesterol. Some previous studies have shown no effect or decreased LDL and increased HDL cholesterol but increased in weight
<br>We cannot conclude beneficial effect of Cow Ghee and butter on cognition; and lipid profile from present study. Effect of cowghee on weight and serum lipid profile was better than butter

 <br>
<br>Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.
<br>We divided 23 C57BL/6NJ males (16-week-old) into 3 groups, and each group received either a control diet, a high-fat diet of coconut oil (coconut oil), or a high-fat diet of omega-3-rich pork lard (omega lard) for 28 days. Thereafter, fasting serum lipids and fecal microbiomes were analyzed.
<br>cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL levels of the omega lard-treated group were significantly reduced compared to the coconut oil-treated group (P &lt; 0.05)
<br>microbiome analysis revealed a significant increase in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae
<br>increased serum lipid content was positively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidaceae (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively correlated with the abundance of Lachnospiraceae (P &lt; 0.05).
<br>The excellent protection offered by omega-3-rich pork lard against hyperlipidemia indicated that pork lard could be used as alternative cooking oil for health-conscious individuals
<br>Western diet, the prevalence of obesity and other metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVDs) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has increased significantly
<br>Several studies evaluated the health benefits of omega-3 supplements, including the improvement of metabolic parameters and cardioprotective effects in an animal model [4]
<br>omega-3 supplement has been reported to manipulate the gut microbiome, including an increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteria and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria
<br>omega-3 fatty acids favored the growth of short-chain fatty acid- (SCFA-) producing bacteria
<br>This indicated that omega-3 can also alter the gut microbiome of mice.
<br>The present study revealed that including omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, not in the form of supplementation but through consumption of omega-3-rich pork lard, lowers serum lipid levels, including the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL. Furthermore, this change in diet does not damage liver and kidney functions.
<br>However, a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids significantly decreases liver weight relative to body weight, suggesting less fat accumulation in the live

- Benefits of DHA and EPA:
    - Epa reduces cellular inflammation, also improved Neuro inflammation (dementia caused from it), good for cardiovascular system, also helps burn excess fat
    - Dha decreases blood triglyceride, increase in hdl, also helps with inflammation , helps muscle recovery, lower blood pressure, decreases mortality, protects telomeres (the longer they are the longer you live)
- They are essential omega 3, so body can't produce them
[6:35](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9JQBczWa6aU&amp;pp=ygUUQmVzdCBvbWVnYSAzIHNvdXJjZXM%3D&amp;t=395)
- Get at least 500-3000mg of omega 3 daily
- Ala converts into dha and EPA but that's not sufficient enough
    - Only coverts 6% in epa, 4% in dha

- There is no overdose of omega 3
- Some people say you can get a vitamin a or d toxicity but there is no reported case that someone got one from natural foods

- Not all anti nutrients are created equal, they also don't come in equal amounts in different food
- Want to be aware of high amounts of phytic acid, oxalic, acid or oxalates, lectins (not all lectins are equal), goitrogenic compounds
- Mostly are in grains nuts and seeds
	- Have most chemical defense cause they are the reproduction of the plants
- Methods to get rid of some are soaking, sprouting and fermenting
- When coming to vegetables it really comes down to the concentration
- Leaves of plants tend to have more anti nutrients compared to the root
- Cooking leaves is good way to lower anti nutrients
- We also want to have it not as main part of diet and have them in moderate amount
- Although in some cases polyphenols and fibers can be helpful in some cases
- Often times people say that certain vegetables have lot of nutrients but they don't consider the anti nutrients
- Root vegetables have least amount of anti nutrients (cause they are already underground)
- Skin typically has more defense then the inside
[4:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NdxNGwDMQ7o&amp;t=261)
- Bloating, gas, slow motility, irretation, stomache aches are all sign that we have probably a already imbalanced gut microbiom
- In such a situation we want to be more careful and even decrease fiber consumption and being careful of which carbs to use
- We not want to cut out carbs all together but change to ones that are easier to digest like honey, ripe fruit, fruit juice even.]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+are-vegetables-actually-toxic.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Are Vegetables Actually Toxic.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 15:51:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Are vegetables really bad for us]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Good for longevity/depression/mood/digestion/even increasing bodies ability to absorb certain nutrients and helping mictobiom
- His favourite for beginners is wim Hof type:
	- After 30min of waking he does it
    - He suggest starting with 3 rounds of 5 breaths and then every day add one breath, end goal is 3 rounds of 30 breaths
    - Breath holding in between
    - It's like exercise you need to train it to get better
    - Normal to get light headed and have tingly hands
    - Breath as deep as possible (diaphragm moving, use entire lung)
    - He raises shoulder and also pull belly out
    - After the rounds hold breath and focus on noise around, get out of head (tongue at top of mouth)
    - The longer you hold breath the better
    - After can't hold breath and then get deep breath and hold again

- Broccoli prevents iodine consumption
- Broccoli can cause thoride problems
	- Especially when get to less iodine
- Removing vegetables can be valuable, so its more individual cause not everyone will benefit from vegetables all the time
- Vegetables overall are better to have in the diet then high fructose corn sirup, seed oils, highly processed fruits
- If you thrive then keep going
[4:11](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdowXuSdMKU&amp;t=251)
- Also kale
- Here there is lot of bio-individuality
- The content of goitrin blocks iodine consumption
- Also increased risk of thyroid cancer when low iodine
[6:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdowXuSdMKU&amp;t=396)
- One type of defense chemicals are oxalates
- Most common in almonds, turmeric powder, spinach, white potatoes, rhubarb

- Start with 1min cold shower and work up to 3min gets all the benefits (colder is not equal to better)
- First can shower warm then can do called one
- Ateries will spasm down and going to clamp all blood
- It forces the blood into the core and the head
- It's basically exercising vascular system
- We have 3 types of muscle (cardiac muscle which is heart muscle, skeleton muscle, smooth muscle which is the muscle that lines our arteries)
- We can exercise that smooth muscle cause it can contract and losen
- The faster you adapt to cold water the faster you'll adapt to cold weather
- You'll feed extra blood to core and to brain
- Also dopamine hit that lasts several hours
- If cold enough liver releases cold shock proteins, when they hit the blood they get rid of free radicals oxidation
	- Free radicals cause cellular damage
    - Even increases rate of protein synthesis (muscle repair)
- Has protein supplement (probably weigh powder for working out)
- We should could plunge prior to exercise
- He has it in morning routine
- Cold plunge activates brown fat (there for Thermostate)
	- Best way to burn fat
- Can die in 72 degree water and not air (cause water is more thermal, 29 times more)
- Start at 48-50 degrees Fahrenheit
- 3min minimum 6min maximum]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+cold-water-exposure-for-fat-burning,-mood-boosts,-and-more-ultimate-human-short-with-gary-brecka.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Cold Water Exposure for Fat Burning, Mood Boosts, and More - Ultimate Human Short with Gary Brecka.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 18:12:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Dairy good or bad for humans]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Raw milk helps people to get ability to metabolized that milk
- There are several disaccharides like sucrose (which is glucose and fructose), other is lactose (which is galactose and glucose)
[25:17](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dExBTIIT0l8&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=1517)

- Study about it
	- Only source of two growth factors
    - Also good for wound healing
- study where compared with flu vaccination
	- colostrum and vaccination did better then just vaccination
- So there is evidence that colostrum is benefitial against flu
- There is a colostrum supplement at his company
[1:10:15](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dExBTIIT0l8&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=4215)

- Overtraining is a real thing
- Calls it mrv (maximum recovery volume)
- But there is MEV (minimum effective volume) 
	- Minimum needed to grow muscle
- If genetically good, good technique and enormous then can get enough stimulus with little reps
- On average MRV is 20 sets per muscle per week but exception to that
	- You can only train whole body so much, but local limit of each muscle is quite high relatively to that
    - So its the systemic fatigue that stops you from going higher not the muscle
    - If would lower upper body training volume and do more legs instead then you could get the volume up to 30-50 sets per week
	    - Benefitial for growing a specific muscle
        - Could do with 1-2 muscles at same time
- Also listen to your body and the need of it for recovery
[18:44](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sChIij1cFDg&amp;t=1124)
- Overall life Stress also leads to fatigue
- You won't loss muscle if you reduce training to a third when needed
- A body is a physical Maschine with limits
	- Push them forsure but not overdo it
- You can do two things with training
	- One is getting results
    - The other is training though ness
    - You don't want the second to interfere with the first]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+dr.-mike-israetel-build-muscle-faster-than-99-of-people-by-doing-this.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Dr. Mike Israetel - Build Muscle Faster than 99% of people by doing this.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 17:54:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Dr. Paul Saladino Claims Oatmeal is the Most Dangerous Food Humans can Eat (and Oat Milk)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Oatmeal is a smashed oat seed
- All plants contain defence chemicals, also seeds
- Saponins is the defence chemical in oats
	- Also quinoa
    - Resilient to cooking
- Heavy mental in oats:
	- Gene that allows accumulation of cadmium (fertility, mental health issues)
- Pesticides:
	- Glyphosate
    - Chlormequat
    - 2,4-Dichlophenoxyacetic acid
    - Atrazine
- Gluten:
	- Distributive for human gut
- Mold toxins:
	- When store grains that comes
- Phytic acid:
	- inhibit absorbtion of minerals
    - Fermented overnight only gets rid of 40% of it
    - Corn and beans also have it
    - Steals minerals from gut
- He thinks a better option for breakfast is steak, hamburger, eggs, fruit, raw milk, joghurt with berry

- Instant oats:
	- Chemicals added
    - Becomes high glycemic
- Thomas says glucose spike isn't necessarily the problem
- Paul thinks insulin has valuable roles in the body (signals to kidney to hold on to minerals/electrolytes, electrolyte balance, also triggers some things with antioxidant balance, more glutathion function)
- Thinks when people are not metabolicly functioning well then you'll have the problem with the high spikes
- He thinks carbs are not a problem for people

- Also vegetables, seeds also have more toxins, pestiztides
- When fruit ripes it losses its defence chemical (Nonprotein Amino Acid)
[6:08](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVKf5ZZnk&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=368)
- How much protein?
	- gram per pound body weight (or goal body weight)
    - Think about protein first
- To complement meat also drink bone broth
- So mix of aminos in most in bone broth
- also eat organs (liver and heart)
	- Half to oz of liver per day most days of the week
    - Heart few uncle's every day
    - Have unique micronutrients
    - Has supplement for it
[7:14](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVKf5ZZnk&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=434)
- Chicken and pork not as clean cause often not feed with grass
- Picture

- Fish even when wild has lots of heavy Metal, ppfas, micro plastics
- Eggs great source but often feed corn and soy
- Carbs:
	- Fruits
    - Not fan of grains
    - Want at least 150g a day and if active more like 350g
    - Has a calculator on his website
    - You could try to use starches
    - Also uses avocado, cucumber, zucchini, squash
[12:23](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVKf5ZZnk&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=743)
- Animal fats:
	- Raw cheese (parmesano regano)
    - Grass-fed butter
    - Fatty ground beef
    - Tallow
- Want 40% of calories from fat, 40% from carbs, 20% from protein​
[13:11](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVKf5ZZnk&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=791)

[7:44](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=464)
- [[@Dr. Robert Lustig|Dr. Robert Lustig]] has YouTube video on sugar (in description)
- Calorie basically unit of energy
[12:17](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=737)
- A calorie burned is a calorie burned
- But that doesn't mean a calorie eaten is a calorie eaten
- If you eat 160 calories in almonds, you absorb 130
- Turns out the fiber (soluble and insoluble one, fiber is more or less key) forms a jell on inside of intestent, the insoluble fiber or also cellulose forms a fishnet, the soluble plugs the holes in it, together they prevent the absorption from the 30 calories, they go further down the intestent to where the micro biome is
- If you feed your gut (microbiome) that's good cause then the gut will turn it into things like short chain fatty acids which are protective against chronic metabolic diseases
- So basically it comes down to what of the calories go to your gut and get absorbed
- That was problem number to
[15:14](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=914)
- Problem two is with protein
- If eat to much protein, if bodybuilder then it goes into other muscle, but if not then your liver has to take them and deamitates them turns them from amino acid to organic acid and that's uses to feed a process that creates atp (chemical energy body needs in order to power itself), so that's good
- It takes double amount of energy to prepare that protein to burn as it does to prepare a carb or fat
- 10% of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperature (thermic effective food)
- With protein actually create more heat (cause it takes double atp)
- Fat doesn't have any thermic effective food cause it doesn't go through the same process
[18:08](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=1088)
- Fats
- Omega 3 (heart healthy, anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's, save your life)
- Trans fats (the poison, can't basically break it down, it lines arteries, liver, causes chronic metabolic disease, insulin resistent)
- Omega 3s don't even get broken down for energy cause they are so important, cause brain/heart needs them
- Trans fats can't be broken down
[30:57](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=1857)
- Carbohydrates (Fructose and glucose):
- Galactose basically becomes glucose
- Glucose is the energy of life (every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy it's so important that if you don't consume it your body makes it (gluconeogenesis)
- You can use ketones but only when in a ketogenic state
- You need glucose for specific structural changes in proteins and hormons
- Fructose on other hand (which we seek, added sugars of food industry are by purpose cause Fructose is addictive)
- No life that needs it (although we have a limited capacity to process it)
- Berries are the lowest fructose of all food
- It's fine to eat fruit cause of the fiber in them (fiber is want mitigates the absorption so that means you feed your microbiom more)
- Fructose inhibits 3 necessary enzymes that are needed for normal mitochondrial function
- Metochondrial has to work at peak efficiency that's what metabolic health is
- The 3 Enzyms are: amp kinase (is the thing that tells liver to create more new mitochondria, Fructose basically locks that process without unlocking it), second one acadl (acyl coa dehydrogenase longchain) (there prepare fatty acid for metabolism), cpt 1(brings fatty acid from outer mitochondrial membrane to inner one so that there can be energy created out of it)
- Paracelsus 15:37
- It's what you do everyday not what you do once
[33:08](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=1988)
- Fructose is in that category
- What makes our life time shorter is primarily sugar, also omega 6, transfats (magarine)
- Magarine lined your liver cause couldn't break transfats down
- If olive oil is heated behond cooking point you create transfats
[35:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=2107)
- There is no study that shows cutting calories makes a difference
- Food industry calls fat is fat, sugar is sugar, calorie is a calorie on purpose (which all is not true)
- With sugar are you talking about dietary sugar or blood sugar
[42:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=2556)
- 65% of what is ingested is used for resting energy expenditure, 10% thermic effective food, 25% goes to activity
- When intake glucose you get big glucose rise in bloodstream and insulin makes it go down
- Insulin is the bad guy in the story
- The higher glucose the more insulin
- That glucose rise itself also leads to various health issues like with arteries and kidney disease (because of change in bloodpressure)
- But really the insulin response makes it all bad
- Insulin takes whatever you are not burning (blood glucose) and puts it into fat for storage (takes 90min)
- Insulin is the energy storage hormone
- If active your muscles will take the glucose irrespective of insulin (used as immediate fuel and glycogen storage)
- Muscles are insulin independent
- Insulin spike is especially one of biggest factors metabolic disease
[46:46](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=2806)
- Study of mice, everything looks healthy like normal blood glucose levels, normal glucose tolerant, not fat, normal insulin levels the only thing is that there kidney dies
- It's the Insulin that makes the kidney die
- Insulin drives growth
- Every cell in body wants to burn at one time and wants to grow at one
- 41 doublings of cells to turn the body into grown state of an adult (10 trillion cells)
[51:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=3079)
- 36 doubleings pre natali, 5 post
- The cell has to know when to grow and when to burn the signal for that is oxygen
- Oxygen also needed for the mitochondria to signal burning
- Absence of oxygen the cell only knows to grow
- Otto Warburg effect
- No cell needs oxygen to grow
- Tumore cells grow like wild cause they don't have oxygen
- There is hyperbaric oxygen therapy
- It's the insulin rise that drives the growth in the absence of oxigen
- If you have oxygen you don't need that much insulin cause you burn instead of store
[54:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=3244)
- Proccessing of glucose: The glucose is basically tuned in uric acid that is then in bloodstream and hopefully go out in the kidney
- That uric acid can inhibit midrochondrial function and also the enzyme that is there to lower your blood pressure (so higher blood pressure than normal)
- It's not necessary a bad thing to eat that beagle if it's in your cloric requirements, and depends on how much you clear and how high the insulin goes
[1:00:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=3652)
- 250 calories of fructose
- Beagle vs soda
- With soda only half of it is glucose so the glucose rise won't be as high
- The glycemic index is garbage
- There is no fructose alone in nature
- Ingestent will metabolism some of fructose (10% turned into fat right away, molecule fat that could be used as fat, triglyceride)
- Rest will be absorbed in Portale vein (goes to liver), but before some of it will be nitrating tight junction proteins
- Intestine is like sewer junk in middle and there job is to put the junk to the anus, absorbing the good stuff
- Intestine bound together with proteins which form a barrier (tight junction proteins)
- If you change the nitrate status of that tight junction it gets leaky, so some of the junk goes through to your bloodstream (leaky gut)
- Causes inflammation of level of liver
- CRP is high (marker for inflammatory immune response which shouldn't be high)
- 93% of Americans have leaky gut
[1:04:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=3843)
- What supports the tight junktions
- 3 barriers in intestine (one is physical mucin layer (if won't feed bacteria your bacteria will feed on you, that's why fiber is so important), didn't mention other two
- So on one hand fasting might be good on other hand you deplete your microbiom
- When you do eat enough fiber and high quality fermented food (so low sugar fermented), the gut. microbiom gets replenished even more then it was before
- Fermented food is good because of the short chain fatty acids
- Microbiom turns fiber into shortchain fatty acids
- Prebiotic (food for bacteria), probiotics (Bacteria itself), post biotic (what bacteria makes to heal you)
[1:10:25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=4225)
- If you want something sweet for desert it's fine
- Price elasticity phenomenon (if price of a good goes up by 1% that should lead to reduction in purchaser consumption, price influences consumption)
- If something is price elasticity when price goes up consumption goes down (eggs have a high one, when egg price +1% then consumption goes down 0.68%, means price elasticity is 0.32)
- Most price inelastic (fast food, soft drinks, juice), they will pay more cause of the sugar
- Keynesian economics (based on concept of rational actor, who can determine value, utility over cost)
- In 1979 Daniel canaman and Amos Tversky described the irrational actor (irrational one can't determine value because he is risk averse, cost always to great)
- Jeffrey Sachs hedonic actor (also can't determine value cause it doesn't matter what it causes they need their fix,that's what's happening)
[1:14:17](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=4457)
- Bread in us has lot of fructose
- The better the bread the quicker it turns bad
- Bread added with sugar turns not bad as quick cause of the sugar
- So even brad has turned into something bad
[1:18:13](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=4693)
- Use sucrose for sugar cause sugar has more then one definition
- Sucrose is what put in coffee (cane sugar, beets sugar)
- It's out of one molecule of glucose one of fructose together
- Body separates them instantly and then glucose goes to entire body (insulin response), fructose straight to liver and generates fat
- High fructose corn syrup is 1 molecule of glucose one of fructose not bound together
- But does the same actually, only difference is economically (cause sucrose would be needed to imported, used with the food manufacturers)
- Because the molecules are free they don't crystalize
[1:29:24](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=5364)
- Every health crisis needs a public health response
- For personal responsibility there are 4 criteria (knowledge, access, affordability, externalities)
- Externalities (your choice can't hurt anybody else)
- Food science (what happens to food in between ground and mouth), nutrition (what happens to food between mouth and cell), metabolic health (is what happens to food Inside the cell)
- All the major disease are inside the cell cause they are al midrochondrial disfunction (there is no medicine that gets there)
[1:54:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=6867)
- Most of Europe and Skandinavien countries, also Australia, Thailand don't allow high fructose corn syrup
- But some of the countries still have the problems cause they have sucros
- Definition of food is substrate that contributes either to growth or burning of an organism
- Ultra processed food inhibits growth and hijackes growth of cancer
- 73% of food in grocery store is consumable poison
- Most starches nowadays have fructose in them
- If get insulin down you not get fat (fat will give up triglyceride in it as soon as insulin goes down)
- Two things that get insulin up is refined carbohydrates and sugar, also in corn feed beef/chicken and fish
- Nova system for categorizing the processed foods (4 classes, class 4 is the problem one)
- They created a online tool on perfect.co (recommendation engine based on metabolism)
- Dr lustig is not low carb he is low insulin
- To get to low insulin need to get rid of refined carbohydrate, of sugar, increase the fiber, get rid of branch chain amino acids (is in protein powder, if build muscle it's okay)
- Fish is good
- Gras feed steak
- American corn fed animal has metabolic Syndrom that's the marbling
- Nothing wrong with eggs (orange yoke egg has lot of omega 3 in it)
- Other sources of omega 3 (Marine life)
- 3 Omega 3 types (ala which is in vedgetables, epa which is only in marine life, dha which you get from Marin life or algea)
- Dr Lustig takes fish oil to increase his omega 3 (1g/day), vitamin c (1000mg/day, mainly for his skin issue), vitamin d
- Vitamin d deficiency is related to all the metabolic diseases but supplementation of it hasn't fixed any of them
- One reason of vitamin d deficiency is soft drinks
- Vitamin d is converted in the liver in a pro hormone means it's inactive, then it can be metabolised two ways one alpha in the kidney that's the active form (which does all activity, calcium absorption of gut, supression of Immunsystem which is s good thing), other form which turns it into inactive form and just gets it out again)
- You need to fix the inflammation first
- To reduce systemic inflammation you decrease fructose, reduce heavy metals like Cadmium (in chocolate)
- Good is fiber, short chain fatty acids
- Increased cortisol (normally antiflammentory) due to sleep deprivation leads to increased inflammation
- Cortisol is good if on right time of day and acutely (late shifted one bad, too much or to frequent bad, you actually need cortisol it's essentially)
[1:56:09](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=6969)
- when under short term stress cortisol helps you
- Chronic stress leads to metabolic and mental health disaster
[1:57:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=7046)
- There are 4 things that increase mitracondrial biogenesis (cold, altitude, ...) that's why Colorado was seen healthier
[2:05:59](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=7559)
- Mentioned something about pool might look into effects of chlor
- There is the data that the food industry has the politicians by money
- Alac organisation they are for whoever gives them money
- Statins only help in certain cases (seconary prevention) for just prevention it only increases life span by 4 days and increases the risk of diabetes by 20%
- Leo not real problem cause two Ldls
- You reduce it by reducing insulin (sugar)
[2:18:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=8306)
- Biggest fast food makers there is is the public schools
- IQ scores went down since the food industry came into the school food
- 3 studies showed that ultra processed food also correlates to depression
[2:26:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=8813)
- Body fat is not body fat
- 3 fat depos
- Subcutaneous fat (big butt fat, you have to gain 10kg of it to get metabolically ill)
- Fats are releasing cytokines they are pro inflammatory they do it at rest
- The fat cell itself is not the problem it's cause it can't handle it anymore
- Drains into systemic circulation
- Fat depos two is visceral (big belly fat, only need 5kg fat to get metabolically ill)
- Drains into portal vein (direct to liver)
- Comes not from calories comes from stress (cortisol)
- Third one is the liver (only quarter of a kilo, a healthy liver weighs 1500g)
- If have fat in liver it causes metabolic disfunction right away
- That fat in the liver comes from either alcohol or sugar
- If want to fix liver fat get rid of alcohol and sugar
- One of reasons intermittent fasting works is cause you give the liver time to offload some of it's fat
- Diet sweeteners don't really reduce the fat
[2:34:02](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=9242)
- Study where tested response to different drinks
- Milk didn't have much impact cause lactose is not a big insulin driver
- Diet soda with zero calories gained 2kg cause had still insulin response
- Insulin response cause still taste sweet
- Also study that showed when eating and also drinking diet soda it conditions the diet soda for a bigger release of insulin
- Also study where they didn't get a insulin response from the artificial sweeteners but when they ate afterwards they ate much more
[2:39:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=9573)
- Dr lustig helped restructure a food company to be healthier
- Company was kdd
- 3 principles to make every food metabolically healthy (protect the liver, feed the gut, support the brain)
- Emulsifiers create gut inflammation
[2:45:20](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=9920)
- Artificial sweeteners blocks leptin (the hormone that tells brain you had enough insulin blocks leptin
- that makes you hungrier, and blocks the rewards
- Chronic overstimulation of neurons leads to neuronal cell death but the exitetory neuron has a plan b, it down regulates the dopamin receptor (less chance of dopamin molecul will find receptor to bind to)
- You get hit, rush, receptors go down, next time bigger hit, until huge hit to get nothing that's tolerance, and when the neurons start to die that's addiction
- A neuron needs energy (most energy depend tissue in the body)
- Caffeine is addictive (not toxic)
[2:56:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=10564)
- Glp1 (acts on brain and gut, decreases rate of gastric emptying)
- Glp1 analogs (used for fat loss, is injected, loose same amount of muscle too so not good)
- These drug causes stomach literally to turn to stone
- Lack of muscle mass is a driver of mortality
- When reduce reward you also reduce desire to live
- Us government makes basically makes 56 billion a year from food
[3:02:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=10968)
- Brain after long time recaps to facilitate the image of the fat person
- If leptin sensitiv you are happy to burn, if resistent you think you are starving
- Have to break through leptin resistance (driver is insulin, cause blocks leptin receptors)
[3:06:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=11186)
- Fructose activates reward center
- Anything that stimulates the reward center in extreme is addictive
- With addiction this is where personal responsibility falls down
- The tabbaco industry invented personal responsibility cause they where being killed on the science and needed other way to keep you smoking
[3:18:43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=11923)
- If rice then brown rice cause of fiber
- Best choice cornbread is highest fiber choice (good bread should have carb to fiber ratio of 3:1, 5:1)
- Meat is based on pasture raised, if organic, if injected with antibiotics
- fermented foods good (kimchi, careful of joghurt should be with live cultures)
- Intermittent fasting (good for right patient, right one is one with liver fat)
- Also he is in a fiber company (munch munch)
- You need inviable fiber
- Nova class 1 food is any food without a lable
- Problem with a label is it only tells you whats in the food and not what has been done with it
[3:21:25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=12085)
- Number one recommendation get rid of sugar number two go from a walk
- Eatreal
[3:24:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE&amp;t=12277)
- Problem is there are 262 names for sugar
- You can't figure it out yourself until there is a line for added sugars
- No greater then 4g per serving
- Anything that has more then 4 ingredients is nova class 4]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+dr.-robert-lustig-how-sugar-&amp;-processed-food-impacts-your-health-huberman-lab-podcast.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Dr. Robert Lustig How Sugar &amp; Processed Food Impacts your health - Huberman Lab Podcast.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 14:42:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Drinking Water is not the best way to stay hydrated]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Can create dehydration by drinking to much water too
- Condition called hyponotrimia (low sodium in the blood), deleted sodium with drinking to much water without salt
- If drink when not thirsty then can end up with low sodium
- Also other liquids can have diaretic effect
- The more sugar in blood the more the body is going to get rid of water in body and the more dehydrated you are going to be
- So glucose dehydrates
- Study on sport drink and soda (people with the sport drinks gained more weight)
[7:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAhvCuJNu3I&amp;pp=ygUJdGFwIHdhdGVy&amp;t=456)
- To be truly hydrated you need all electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium)
- Book water log
[9:35](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAhvCuJNu3I&amp;pp=ygUJdGFwIHdhdGVy&amp;t=575)
- You can use Urin strips to measure if you are hydrated
- You measure specific gravity there (basically measures how concentrated the Urin is compared to water)
- Water has density of 1 and Urin should have one from 1.002-1.03
- Less then 1.010 then that's mild hydration
[10:14](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAhvCuJNu3I&amp;pp=ygUJdGFwIHdhdGVy&amp;t=614)
- A lot of electrolytes are coming from food
- But there are also things that will deplete the electrolytes (coffee, tea, alcohol, fruit juice, soda, sugar drinks)]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+drinking-water-is-not-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Drinking Water is not the best way to stay hydrated.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 04:40:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Fasting for Detoxification and Longevity Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Ultimate Human Short]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- He wrote ultimate guide to water fasting
- In ancient time fasting was used by a lot of civilication (Romans, greeks, egyptens), it was used to cleanse the body
- Also religion has fasting in it
- There are a lot of animals that use fasting
- Fasting and time restricted feeding improves metabolic health and logevity
[5:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5V0I0U_YxQs&amp;t=352)
- Study showed that it effects health and longevity
- Body eats waste components in body if fasting (authpagy)
- It improves waste elimination, repair, detoxification and regeneration of cells (both fasting and caloric restriction have an effect
[12:42](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5V0I0U_YxQs&amp;t=762)
- 3 day water fast:
	- 0-12h after last meal still digest some food and insulin still little high
	    - We want to be sensitive to insulin cause the less insulin it takes to regulate our blood sugar the longer we life
    - 12-18h 5s when fat burning begins
	    - Body in ketosis
    - 18-24h glucagon rises
	    - It counter acts the effect of insulin by stimulating the liver to turn stored glucose into sugars (gluconeogenesis)
    - 24-48h is when real magic happens
	    - waste elimination, repair, detoxification, cellular decision
        - Is called the cleansing part (more clearity in mind)
    - 48-54h tore magic happens
	    - Growth hormon is more
        - HGH is released to repair things
    - 54-72h is where insulin increases its sensitivity
	    - Authpaegy is highest there
        - Stem cells get released in bloodstream and hunt around for damaged/inflamed tissue
- Intermittent and water fasting has lots of benefits]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+fasting-for-detoxification-and-longevity-ancient-wisdom-meets-modern-science-ultimate-human-short.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Fasting for Detoxification and Longevity Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Ultimate Human Short.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 06:18:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Gary Brecka’s 8 Methods to Increase Longevity on a Budget]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- For defining Biological age you can use bio markers, telemere lengths, glygen age test
- 3 things to improve your longevity:
	- Get data (bloodwork)
    - Keep small promises to yourself (for example go to bed at ...)
    - Develop a morning routine (sunlight, grounding, cold showers, breathwork takes him 8 min)
- Middle category (under 1000):
	- Get genetic methylation test
    - Photobiomodulation (red light, some spas/gyms do have it)
    - PEMF matt (could be good after workout)
    - Targeted supplementation (vitamin d3, k3, methylated multivitamin)

- Anti nutrients
- Oxelates all plants have it
	- Even mammals have it
    - Sun exposure leads to them
    - Perhaps to stop insects
- Lectins, Phytates are other ones
- When eating them in modertation then they can be beneficial
[6:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6HRgMr7_ns&amp;pp=ygUjdmVnZXRhYmFsZXMgd2l0aCBsb3cgYW50aSBudXRyaWVudHM%3D&amp;t=392)
- Phytic acid
	- Typically found in grains, nuts and seeds
    - Concern is it can bind up minerals
    - He hasn't seen anyone with a balanced diet and high amount of phytic acid he didn't see some evidence of it happening
    - Also its a difference to only look at phytic acid and it being combined with other things in vegetables
    - People actually life longer consuming it
    - It seems to be anti inflammentory, anti oxidant
    - There are ways to reduce the phytic acid content one is fermenting (sour dough actually reduces in phytic acid and gluten when fermented), other way is soaking
[15:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6HRgMr7_ns&amp;pp=ygUjdmVnZXRhYmFsZXMgd2l0aCBsb3cgYW50aSBudXRyaWVudHM%3D&amp;t=933)
- Thomas carbs in his diet basically contain of lentils, legumes, fruits, vegetables. Kefir and cottage cheese
- Lectins:
	- All living beings produce lectins these are like signaling molecules
    - Evidence that it causes problems for humans comes in two forms test tubes studies, when people consume undercooked food (in the studies they got food poisons cause it wasn't cooked but they then didn't get any problems after it).
    - Undercooked food is higher in lectins
    - By cooking you remove the lectins to a point that they aren't even that noticable
    - Micro dosing stuff with lectins doesn't do you harm it is actually more beneficial (even studies on it lowers the risk of cancer)
    - Also not even that high consumption of things with it in America
- Anti frigal concept (giving little stress, to build some resistance to it)
[17:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6HRgMr7_ns&amp;pp=ygUjdmVnZXRhYmFsZXMgd2l0aCBsb3cgYW50aSBudXRyaWVudHM%3D&amp;t=1020)
- Blue zones healthiest populations
	- What they all eat is legumes so they consume there lectins
    - Also people that eat legumes life longer and it also has lots of health benefits
[19:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6HRgMr7_ns&amp;pp=ygUjdmVnZXRhYmFsZXMgd2l0aCBsb3cgYW50aSBudXRyaWVudHM%3D&amp;t=1140)

- Grounding good for body
- Lot of things we blame for ageing are not due to it are actually lack of raw material and also lack of natural things
- Disease doesn't thrive in alkaline environment
- Its not possible to change pH by drinking water
- pH = potential of Hydrogen (so a energy)
- Touch grass barefoot
- We discharge in the earth
[6:58](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FFio155APgU&amp;t=418)
- We change the electrical field in the body when discharging
- Some benefits are that we repolarize the surface of your cells
- When cells repell by charge that's a good thing
- Want to get more oxygen in the cell especially into red blood cells and free up as much surface area for it
- It restores iron channels that are like bouncers at a club
- We are not powered by nutrients we eat or by oxygen we breath, we are powered by adp (made in mitochondria)
- 10% of body weight is mitochondria
- 110 trillion mitochondrial
[8:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FFio155APgU&amp;t=512)
- As little to 3-5 min will change pH and polarization

- We got far away from basics like sunlight, grounding, breathing
- When you put a stress on a body it strengthens
- Re thinks aging is the aggressive persuit of comfort
- Disease isn't caused by lack of drugs
- Vitamin d also has effect on auto immunity
- Body only makes one vitamin on its own and that's vitamin d (make it from sunlight and cholesterol)
- It also acts more like a hormone non vitamin comparable to it
- The darker skin the worse you take up vitamin d3 (that's also why there skin looks better when older)
[21:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K4eRDUaHj-w&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=1264)

- If on carnivore and not eating grass fed meat or raw dairy that's also not that good
- Pesticides, herbicides, insecticides is not good
- Glyphosate is terrible (banned in most Europe countries)
- When food is genetically modified the body often doesn't recognize it (get even less nutrients)
- The seed oil itself is not bad its bad that it gets heated and also chemically changed
- If make it simple you need only 5 oils in your life:
	- Four to use for cooking (extra virgin coconut oil, tallow, grass fed butter/ghee
    - 100% extra virgin olive oil
[26:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K4eRDUaHj-w&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=1597)

	- Better omega 3 to omega 6 ratio
    - Linoleic acid
    - Caliber the saturated fat
    - Also they get light metals from the soil
    - Also healthy bacteria
    - Also the skull will look better of the natural raised cow

- If can't break down homocysteine then can become one of most inflammatory compounds
- It irritates the artery
- Aerie get smaller so you get higher blood pressure
- Even if the heart isn't effected we still medicate it
- You could also get pholate from green leafy vegetables, grass fed meats/eggs
- All about MTHFR gene mutation
[1:02:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K4eRDUaHj-w&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=3730)

- Muscles are metabolic currency
- It's a sponge for sugar and glucose
- Increases metabolic rate
- Helps determine metabolism and body temperature
- Grip strength is important cause when you fall you try to grab stuff
- Grip strength actually directly correlated to longevity
	- There's a measure for how long you should be able to dead hang by age
- Also lean muscle mass directly correlated to longevity
- Resistant training is important
- The best thing in bad mood is to move our bodies

- Ideal morning routine:
	- Thinks that little wins strengthen us
    - Best thing first is a cold shower (1-3min)
	    - Water can remove temperature of body 29 times the rate compared to air
	        - That's why you can die of temperature of water and not air (story with 3 NFL players on fishing trip)
        - Liver increases of cold shock proteins due to panic of body
        - Release a survival gene
        - Forcing oxygen
        - Activate brown fat (our thermostat), mitrochondrial has affinity for it
        - Also helps lower blood sugar and insulin sensitivity
        - Also increases mood
    - Drink 10oz of hydrogen water (if able to)
    - Then go outside and expose skin to the sun (first 45 min of Day best, only uva no uvb)

	- Nanometers in light matter
    - We are very photovoltaic beings
    - Effects on Parkinson, inflammation, improved collagen elastin/fibrin, hair follicle restauration, Inflammation microvascular circulation
    - He does minimum 10min (if able he does 20min)
    - Mitrochondrial nitric oxide is released and that 2 times adp (energy) production
	    - Basically kick the mitrochondrial oxide out and oxygen in instead
    - Get some benefit of it by sunlight
    - Gary tested it with nitric oxide test strips
    - Study where 15min of red light Therapie reduced blood glucose levels
- Ben Greenfield also biohacker

- Raw milk can improve stiffness in the joints (wulzen factor)
- High heat in milk production denatures proteins, breaks down antibody effects, kills good bacteria)
[2:56](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ragPQeYRB8c&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=176)

	- Anti stiffness
    - Called after Rosalind wulzen
    - Anti inflammatory
    - Paper on it

- Gut microbiom:
	- Handle fuel better
    - More energy
    - Also in yoghurt also often pasteurized also kefir
    - But study showed that raw kefir changes the microbiom positively
    - Also helps handle foods better
    - A lot of processed food has lactose in it even if you wouldn't think so
    - Raw milk has lactese and other compounds in it that help you digest lactose
    - Maybe lactose intolerance is just lack of the ight enzyme and bacteria to break it down
    - Also can help to add probiotic with raw milk together to help gut to restabilize

- immune system:
	- 1-2 weeks in
    - Immune system feels better
    - Recover better
    - Anti bodies and some Enzyms that are connected to immune system would also effect the human (study)
	    - Raw milk consuming ones had 30% less illness

- Essential fatty acids:
	- After 2-3 weeks
    - Tore mental acuity and better mood
    - We kill or harm over 350 fatty acids by pasteurization
    - Also talks about omega 3
    - You'll be also less hungry
[13:13](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ragPQeYRB8c&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=793)
- More pathogens (actually what pasteurization is for to kill off)
- Study about it
- 20-40% occurrence
- Also 9-10% of pasteurtized milk had it]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+here’s-what-eating-dairy-every-day-does-to-your-stomach-fat,-brain,-and-gut.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Here’s What Eating Dairy EVERY DAY Does to Your Stomach Fat, Brain, and Gut.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 17:02:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+HONEY -vs- High-Fructose Corn Syrup (Is Honey Healthier) 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[

	- Blood sugar was checked after 20, 60, 90, 120 minutes after ingestion (if want to check then use that)
    - Also checked insulin levels
    - Glucose response was same in all 3 the same (with people with normal glucose Toleranz)
    - Also pretty similar with people with a impaired glucose Toleranz
    - Insulin spike after all 3 also
    - Also triglyceride levels also go up afterwards

- Place the light lower (desk lamps, lamps on floor)
- At night use as little light as possible
- Ideally candle light/moon light (both very low light intensity, candle only 3-5 lux)
- Worst lights are overhead floristic lights
- The bright light will destroy melatonin
- Between 10 pm and 4 am avoid the bright light

- Methylation (same as your car needs refined crude oil)
- There is no nutrient that enters body and is used in same version everything needs to be refined
- If you can't do that conversion you have a deficiency
- That process is called methylation (several genes that govern it)
- Really a disease is passed from a family member
[3:35](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D0EEC891CM8&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=215)
- What we pass from generation to generation is the inability to refine raw material which causes a deficiency
[5:02](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D0EEC891CM8&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=302)
- If you can't break the amino acid Homocysteine down to methionine, it will rise and it'll irritate the aterie
- That's irritation makes it shrink smaller thus higher blood pressure

- Lip balm actually not good thing to do cause a lot of times it has alcohol/some solvent/mineral oil in it that actually pulls oil out of lips and you need more of it
- Same with hand cream
- Behind dry lips there's a vitamin B2 deficiency
    - Leads to dry lips
    - Eventually to cracked corners of mouth
    - Could become infected with fissures (Candida)
- Vitamin b2 is co enzyme has function of breaking down fats and ensuring that the skin is lubricated

[3:12](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=192)
- Saliva is important and benefitial
[3:50](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=230)
- Mateina brand that makes lose leave yerba mate
- Helix sleep makes mattresses/pillows
[12:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=768)
- Oral health is linked to brain and body health
- Also if think you to your teeth good and brush teeth twice flush them and go to the dentist often then there is a chance that if you don't look at the mictobiom you don't do that much good
- People that so less often have overall healthier microbiom doesn't mean its always the case but there is a possibility
- He talked to a few dentists
[20:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=1210)
- Mouth anatomy:
	- Teeth
	    - are layered structures different layers
        - Outer layer is enamel which is translucent, under it there is the dentin
        - cavities forms from outside to inside, cavites puts in holes where the bacteria goes down the enamel and if unlucky go to dentin, goal is to avoid cavities and fill in the cavities
    - Based on mouth being acidic or basic is either demineralization (de min) and remineralization (re min)
    - Remineralisation is good cause it is the process by within the enamel and some extend in deeper dentin layer there can be the addition of new minerals that form robust chains of crystals, so you'll fill back in holes from cavities
    - If cavities on two teeth then chances that they are at the same level
[26:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=1581)
- Teeth are always in state of eighter de min or re min
- Largely dependend of the pH of mouth which largely depends on how much saliva you produce and how mineralized it is
- Gums (gingiva) also important role in keeping the teeth stable, its like a seal around the teeth (the pockets should low)
- Typical all holes are protected in some way, but we have a huge hole (mouth) that's filled with bacteria
- Mouth breathing also not good for teeth health
- If pH is right in mouth we kill off bad stuff and the good stuff can be there
- Oral cavity also can take cuts and with rare exceptions heals up with nearly zero scar
- By supporting tooth health you also support gum health
- If gum not good then it could cause periodontal disease which can lead to alzheimers
[34:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=2094)
- How cavity forms:
	- When goes down dentin layer need to be filled
    - Goal is to keep teeth in re min
    - No specific food causes it, not even sugar
    - It forms by bacteria that feeds on sugar, they create acid that goes down and demineralizes the teeth in area of carvity
    - The bacteria (major one is streptococcus mutants) that causes it, is not what you are born with (you give it to one another)
	    - It's hungry for sugar
    - If already more de min then much faster cavities
    - Carbonated drinks (also acid)
    - He mentioned he is a omnivore (he eats starches, vegetables, fruits)
    - Strep mutants will feed on other stuff if you eat no carbs
    - So you want to keep your mouth as alkaline as possible
    - Key point is degree to which mouth is in de min or re min state and degree to which cavities has the opportunity to form is dependend on the amount of time the mouth is net acidic/alkaline (no one can avoid mouth being acidic once in a while)
[42:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=2574)
- Tooth mineralization:
	- The crystals form in specific type of bond (these are very strong)
    - They are though to tear apart
    - A bond is as strong as many points its held by
    - The minerals form in specific angles and specific ways to ensure more points
    - The mineral that is there to do that job is hydroxy apetite, not indestructible cause acid can break that bonds (that's de min process)
- Floride is not a vitamin, mineral nor a essential nutrient, but it can replace some of hydroxy apetite bonds in teeth and make those bonds hyper strong (super strong)
- But it can disrupt brain and thoride health, it can be a poison
- He has links to toothpaste in description
- If against fluoride then should care more about remineralization of teeth
- Also some data that fluoride is not that good for oral microbiom
[53:45](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=3225)
- Tool (don'ts for oral health):
	- Don'ts:
	    - Alcohol (disturbing of microbiom, also de min)
        - Stimulants (methantamin, aderal, vivance, any drug that increases epinephrine and norepinephrin, chemical reason is they change pH of mouth, mechanical reason is that they mouthbreath more)
        - Mouthbreathing
        - smoking
        - Sugar (if eat then rinse or best brush teeth after eating it)
        - Mouth washes
        - Also other food particles in mouth are not good
        - acidic food (limit time mouth is acidic)
[57:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=3447)
- Tool (fasting, remineralization):
	- Certain times in day where mouth makes maximum amount of salavia thus have optimal opportunity to have rights pH
	    - During day time middle time
        - Eating can disrupt that
        - Best to have time like 2-3 to even 6 hours where you don't eat anything can be very benefitial
    - So intermittent fasting can be benefitial (he does it eats 11am and last food by 8pm)
    - In morning and day have that opportunity to create lots of saliva
    - In middle of night saliva production is very reduced, that's why you wouldn't want to have any food particles in mouth cause salvia can't do its job as effecient
    - Night is critical time so brush your teeth there
    - Brushing two times good (or even 3 times)
[1:08:31](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=4111)
- How to brush:
	- Most dentists say need to brush and floss (twice a day)
    - Use a soft toothbrush
    - Medium/hard brushes disrupt the gum
    - Moving brush in circular motion without much pressure
    - With electric toothbrush also not to much pressure
    - Also adviced to brush the gum (increase blood flow thus better taking of nutrients, especially if sensitive teeth)
[1:09:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=4143)
- Main goal with brushing is to break up the biofilm layer
- So when the strep mutants get there the form a layer which isn't good (plaque)
- When plaque gets hard its Tara which needs to be scrubbed off by the dentist
- When already yellowish then probably tardy and brushing won't remove that
- When dentist polish teeth they make the teeth smooth and that's cause then the bacteria can't hold on to the teeth that easily
[1:11:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=4286)
- Flossing:
	- You need to glide down the teeth
    - Use circular motion
    - Floss twice a day (at least once a day)
    - Water pick could be good idea
    - Children who have spaces between teeth which they typically do, don't have to floss
[1:19:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=4793)
- Changing chemistry of mouth:
	- Xylitol (low calorie sweetener)
	    - Gets eaten by the bacteria but it can't create the acid and also it kills the bacteria
        - Some evidence that it supports gut microbiom
    - If that is there in min and hours after the meal then it will feed on it
    - Also reduces inflammation of the gum tissues and other inflammation in the mouth
    - So there are xylitol gums (1-2 after meal)
	    - Also increases production of saliva
        - He has a link in describtion
[1:23:47](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5027)
- Toothpaste:
	- Xylitol in it good thing
    - Flouride or avoid it?
    - Hydroxyapatite
	    - Mineral that naturally form the bonds
        - If without flouride then use one with that
    - He also has some links in bio
[1:26:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5197)
- Mouthwash:
	- Most especially the ones containing alcohol are terrible
    - The deplete certain things of the mucosal lining of the mouth and disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbiom
    - Also there are anti septic ones (probably prescribed by dentist, should ask them if they are bad)
    - If you really want one then it shouldn't be a antiseptic
[1:33:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5599)
- Cost saving alternatives:
	- Baking soda would brush of biofilm (save for enamel of teeth)
    - Mouthwash with baking soda, hydrogen peroxide not good idea, cause hydrogen peroxide is something you don't want to get into oral cavity
    - High salt water solution (where won't fully dissolve cause of high sodium), that as dental rinse is good for production of healthy mouth bacteria (don't swallow it)
[1:33:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5609)
- Alcohol based mouthwashes also reduce nitric oxide produced in oral cavity
- Nitric oxide is important cause it promotes vasuldilation (when nasal breath, oral microbiom is healthy we improve it)
	- It's good for aterial and capillary health
- So we don't want to reduce it
[1:37:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5836)
- Canker sore
	- We can prevent it or improve healing
    - There's link between gut biom with oral one
    - To support the gut biom you should consume at least 1-4 servings of low sugar fermented food per day
	    - Has own video on it
    - Also consuming enough fiber (vegetables, don't things you should get the supplements all the times)
    - Mentions doctor mark burhenne
	    - He also pointed out that sleep is important
        - Fewer sleep affects the gut and oral biom
[1:39:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=5988)
- Tongue Brushing:
	- Different locations in mouth have different microbiom with good and bad bacteria
    - Tongue scraping (brushing) can be a good idea
    - Lightly brushing the tongue might be better (but seperaten toothbrush)
	    - Cause don't crossover the bacteria
    - But if use scrub then with low force
- Toothbrush care:
	- After use rinse off and dry it
    - One has to decide how much bacteria they are willing to keep on toothbrush
[1:47:42](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=6462)
- Fillings:
	- If there is cavity ask the dentist
    - Metal fillings (lead ones bad, many metal fillings contain mecury)
	    - To not disrupt those mercury ones avoid mastic gum (thick gum) or hard candy
    - if to deep it needs to be filled
[1:51:43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=6703)
- Dentist visits:
	- Twice a year is recommendation
    - Routine cleanings only get rid of plaque
    - It's like a checkup to look how the practicing doing
[1:53:57](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=6837)
- Oral health promotes cardiovascular/gut health
[1:56:13](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCaYyUWWSw&amp;t=6973)
- Oil Pulling:
	- Some evidence
    - But not enough evidence
- Vitamin d with teeth]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+how-to-improve-oral-health-&amp;-its-critical-role-in-brain-&amp;-body-health.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+How to Improve Oral Health &amp; Its Critical Role in Brain &amp; Body Health.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 17:50:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+How to make homemade animal-based sunscreen]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Most normal sun screen contains seed oils
	- That extra linoleic acid in skin leads to more suceptible skin cells to sun and therefore damage thus higher risk of skin cancer
- He puts tallow, bees wax, coconut oil and zinc
[2:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AsUmqF5A208&amp;pp=ygURbmF0dXJhbCBzdW5zY3JlZW4%3D&amp;t=125)
- It has such good ingredients that you actually could eat it
- The zinc powder is non nano
- Want a double boiler to melt the ingredients
[2:34](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AsUmqF5A208&amp;pp=ygURbmF0dXJhbCBzdW5zY3JlZW4%3D&amp;t=154)
- In normal sunscreen there is oxybenzone/octorylene/avobenzone which is linked to cancer
[3:41](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AsUmqF5A208&amp;pp=ygURbmF0dXJhbCBzdW5zY3JlZW4%3D&amp;t=221)
- Zink is what protects from uvb and uva
- The ingredients are not comedogenic (don't cause pores to clog)
[6:15](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AsUmqF5A208&amp;pp=ygURbmF0dXJhbCBzdW5zY3JlZW4%3D&amp;t=375)
- Shows how he makes it
	- 2tbs bee wax
    - 1/2 cup coconut oil
    - 1/2 cup of tallow
    - Melts those 3 then adds zinc (non nano one, this is the uvb/uva blocking part of sunscreen)
    - Then does it away from the heat and stirs it
    - You could make it more tinted by putting cacao in there]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+how-to-make-homemade-animal-based-sunscreen.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+How to make homemade animal-based sunscreen.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 05:09:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+How to Optimize your water Quality & Intake for health - Huberman Lab Podcast]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- pH of water has impact on how you can absorb and utilities that water
- And also have impact on certain bio systems
[3:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=199)
- Temperature affects rate of absorption and impact on cells/tissues/organs
[3:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=207)
- Zero to low cost tools to get most out of water
[3:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=213)
- When and how to hydrate your body best
[4:22](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=262)
- Cold exposure has benefit on fat loss, reduce inflammation, increase metabolism, increase in mood and focus
- 6h after strength training no cold plunge and cold showers don't effect that
- Look at cold exposure episode for more
[10:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=648)
- They had 3 degrees cold water for 2 min, once a week
- In addition they did minimum of 5 cold showers per week (10 degrees, just for 30 seconds)
- Subjects should warm up naturally after exposure (not from cold to warm, 10 min period)
[12:20](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=740)
- A lot of benefits found
- Better mood, sexual satisfaction improved (could be to testosterone increase)
- Improvement in anxiety regulation
- Fat loss after 8 weeks
- Study in description
[14:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=869)
- If do cold shower you want it to hit head, back of neck and back
- Triggers adaptation of brown fat especially when those areas are hit
[18:22](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=1102)
- He is not on a keto diet
[24:42](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=1482)
- H2O is polirized
- Positiv + negativ connect
- The molecules can arrange themselves in different ways
- Temperature determines the arrangement strongly
- 3-4 forms of water (liquid, gas, etc.)
- Other then other things water is less dense in it's solid state
- That's also why ice floats
- If that wasn't life wouldn't probably even exist
[28:06](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=1686)
- The surface level of water let's certain things float there
- It's cause there is a very thin layer on the water surface that is more dense
[31:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=1879)
- 4th phase of water is structured water
- In presence of certain solids/liquids the water molecules can change
- It's when in an environment the Positiv molecules allow to attract one another
- These bond's are stronger then
- Some people believe that structured water also is in our body
- Example would be water on glass that forms something like a bubble
- Water can also bind to certain surfaces
[34:34](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=2074)
- pH and temperature important on how body uses water
- There are own biological mechanism that are there to get water in our cells at different rates and use it in different ways
[36:25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=2185)
- Water is the one molecule that has a big impact on our bodies
[40:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=2429)
- Water can change the confirmation of other things (dissolve something)
- They dissolve cause they are hydrophilic
- Water is a better dissolvent then acid
- Lipids (oils) won't easily dissolve in water (they are hydropholic)
- Bind vs not bind
- pH and temperature will have impact on if eighter of those has a greater or worse tendency to interact with water
[54:15](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=3255)
- Every cell needs water
- Water can access body through drinking and also through inhaling of humid air
- Water needs to move from stomage to bloodstream to cells
- Two ways water can access cells:
	- First way is diffusion: outside of most cells is out of lipid, water and that lipid alter just so that they can connect and the water can be dissolved, this takes much longer then the second way
    - Second way is by aquaporin channels: this are portables through the membrane where the molecules can pass through (1 million per second), the inside of those channels is very hydrophobic
- The reason of two ways is that there are certain tissues that need water often very quickly or release it (tear glands, also in gut)
- There are really no cell that doesn't have the aquaporin channels besides bones and ligaments to some extend
- Pasha tissue might be interesting
- Aquaporin channels can be used in when we move from low to high mobility states
- The movement through that channels is heavily dependent on water temperature and ph
- The pH of the body (pH of cells at different locations) is strongly homeostaticly regulated meaning it doesn't change that much (bio mechanical processes that ensure it stays the same)
- True that different cells different ph ( between 7,2-7,4, gut pathway very different ph)
- Thus pH of water doesn't affect the pH of body but it's still important
- If pH is to low it will not move as quickly from gut into the cell
- True that more alcalin water (pH&gt;7,4) can move more easily
- Absorbed more quickly (if not to high pH)
- Don't need high pH water to hydrate body well
[55:13](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=3313)
- Can by temperature or filtering water to affect the rate of absorption of water in the gut
- That will reduce inflammation and also makes sure you get proper hydration of different cell types in the body
- Also rapid hydration of brain cells that can enhance cognitive function
[59:09](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=3549)
- If water is in the cells it's going to be incorporated through different proteins, organelles
- Many of the processes involve the bonding or lack of bonding with water molecules and proteins
- Reactive oxygen species (or free radicals, anti oxidants, all that really describes the presents or absents of charges that are bound or unbound)
- Free radicals can damage cells because they are free electrons (cause they are free they can bind to cells and change them causing the damage)
- Cells deal with those free radicals through anti oxidants (they are molecules that can be in different forms, sometimes vitamins, they bind up free radicals or repair bonds between cells so that the cells don't have the bad influence anymore)
- There is no disease that doesn't have Ros
- Also no benefit into antioxidant interference getting in the way of the oxidative process
- All learned so far is organic chemistry
[1:00:50](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=3650)
- Water can act as antioxidant if it bonds to things in proper way which requires it to go into cells in the right amount and rate therefore the temperature and ph must be correct
- Also there needs to be enough water and it shouldn't contain things that are damaging
- Potentially carring good things in it potassium, sodium
- When water is inside cells then it can interact and change conformation of different proteins and exelerate or slow down different cellular reactions
- Water can effect disease, health, repair of different cells
[1:14:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=4450)
- Baseline hydration:
- How much?
- Independed of body weight
    - For every hour awake in the first 10h of the day you should consume on average 8oz (240ml) of fluid
        - So that's 2,4l of water in first 10h
        - 10h cause in night requirement not that high
        - If exercise then more fluid needed (there is galpin equation, bodyweight in pound/30 = number of oz fluid to ingest every 15-20min on average while exercise, in metric 2ml per kg every 15-20min)
        - For performance it is recommended to consume it consistently in workout otherwise it's just on average
        - If exercise for 1h then can replace 8oz of baseline by galpin Formular
        - Sweeting is adapting (can sweat more)
        - Exercise in hot environment 50-100% increase the galpin
        - In sauna more like 8oz or even 16oz
        - If feel hydrated then drink more (then fluid with no diaretics)
    - Can't we just follow natural thirst?
    - Can Urin color indicate if we are hydrated or not?
    - There are many studies that show that when we are dehydrated our body and brain doesn't function as well (even 2% has impact)
    - It effects physical performance, cognitive performance (memory, focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking)
[1:23:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=5009)
- Double fluid intake for hot environment exercise or sauna
- If feel dehydrated then can drink more like 16oz per hour while feel dehydrated
- Thirst reasonable guide for when we are dehydrated but it doesn't really keep up with our bodys level of dehydration
- If feel dehydrated then ideally drink something without caffeine or other diaretics (cause release of urination out of body)
- If use caffeine put I'm some sodium and potassium, magnesium
- If caffeine then increase non caffeine intake to a 2:1 for every volume caffeine
- Dehydration can show up in brain fog
- Fluid intake elevates alertness it's due to the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system (aspect that makes you more alert)
- When we have fluid in gut, cells are well hydrated and our bladder contains fluid there is a elevated activation of the sympathetic nervous system by two pathways
- Mechanical: stretch receptors (bladder and gut, like trp/peaso), these cells and channels sense temperature/mechanical pressure or expansion of tissue (mechano sensetion)
    - Chemical level (sends info to areas of brain associated with sympathetic arousal which makes us more alert, that's what wakes us up in sleep if we need to pee)
- Alertness translates to enhanced cognitive/physicsl function

- Filtration of fluids by body by kidneys and by way of bladder and through urination is cycadian depend
- Cells of especially kidney, gut (actually all) all that is under strong control of the cycadian clock genes (influence level of activation of organ)
- Thus for first 10h kidney most active
- Filtering of kidney not only depends on volume but also on rate of ingestion
- So drinking fast, so faster put it out
[1:36:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=5760)
- Tap water:
	- It's not a good outlook if you look on what's contained in it
	- Much if not all tap water contains bad things
	- Hard water contains magnesium and calcium which is good (that in general effects the pH, the higher concentration the higher pH)
	- DBP (disinfection byproducts) concentration (water treatment facilities treat water with that products and that products create byproducts, that can strongly impact pH of water by changing concentration of magnesium and calcium)
	- DBPs can cause endogene disruption that are not good for reproduktiv health (has video on fertility and vitality)
	- Google zip code and ask for water analysis of the tap water
	- You should look if there are high low or moderate levels of fluoride in it
	- Concentration of Fluoride is a concern for the thyroid hormone system
	- Thyroid has lot of roles in brain and body
	- It is very important
	- Study on impact of fluoride (effects t3 hormones, even in standard concentration 0.5mg per l)
[1:41:39](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=6099)
- How best filter drinking water:
	- Range from carbon type filters (Brita type filters) can work if change filter often enough, but not Filter out Fluoride
	- Search for at home water filters that filter out Fluoride
	- Link in the description
	- Could also get whole house water filter (cost more)
	- Intermediate ones are ones like birckey
[1:54:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=6844)
- Higher magnesium in water can lower cardiovascular mortality
- Magnesium 8,3-19,4 mg per liter had decreased likely hood of cardiovascular mortality by 25% compared to 2,5-8,2 mg per liter
- Numbers from study
- So turns out that harder water is better
- The major effect by which magnesium and calcium effect the cardiovascular health, is that the waters pH is higher (7,9-9/9,2) therefore better absorbed and that benefits the cardiovascular system
[1:55:35](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=6935)
- Boiling water will not help with the containment cause some are made even worse through it
- He mentioned he is carnivore
- Cold water will be slower to absorb
[2:02:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=7346)
- Water types:
	- Distilled, double distilled (magnesium and calcium removed), better not drink it
    - reverse osmosis ( it ideally let's magnesium and other minerals in it, but lower amounts of it)
    - Deuterium depleted water (water extracted near sea levels have more deuterium in them, is the enrichment or lack of hydrogen in the water)
    - Electrolyte reduced water also as hydrogen rich water, or hydrogen enriched water or deuterium depleted water all having the property of having higher pH then other forms of water
[2:10:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=7821)
- Hydrogen enriched water:
	- You can create it when putting magnesium tablets in water
    - You should drink it 5-15 minutes
    - There is a review on it
    - So basically that all comes down cause the hydrogen also increases the pH which is the real factor
    - Also study on it
    - Reduced inflammation
    - He also drinks it
    - If tap water already has high magnesium then he thinks you don't need to hydrogen enrich the water (although analyze the water and filter out byproducts)
[2:12:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=7920)
- To create hydrogen water is to purchase molecular hydrogen tablets which are basically magnesium tablets that resolve in water and create free hydrogen
- Study that explains how it works
- Other magnesium tablets won't work
[2:13:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=at37Y8rKDlA&amp;pp=ygUadGFwIHdhdGVyIGFuZHJldyBodWJlcm1hbiA%3D&amp;t=8032)
- Want to do it once or twice a day
- Don't need to do it in all water you drink
- Also don't want to put them into carbonated water, also not hot water

- Top 4 no no ingredients:
	- High fructose corn sirup (labeled as all natural sugars, hfcs, or entire name, also labeled as corn syrup/corn sugar/natural fructose flavoring/natural flavoring)
	    - Can lead to overeating and weight gaining
    - Sodium nitrate (a lot think its just salt, its not salt, not same thing, is not save says cancer institute)
	    - Good is (labels like grass fed/uncured/free range/nitrate free)
    - Aspartame (study on it, has effects on behaviorale and cognitive function, also second study, used as artificial sweetener)

- For gaining weight you should drink lots of milk
- After a certain age mammals can't digest milk as good (typically sugar in milk)
	- Half of population can't digest it fully without side effects
- All 3 macro nutrients in milk carb (mostly lactose, need species specific milk)/fat/protein in perfect ratio
- We have enzyme called lactese that helps breakdown lactose
- Some people have inflammation caused by dairy

- Studies on it
- 27 studies combined, conclusion of it is that fluoride has a bad affect
- There is impact on cognitive function (could impact children development, study)
- 52 of 55 studies decreases in child IQ with fluoride consumption
[3:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JlfJEVWPJUQ&amp;t=185)
- Breathwork guide at the ultimatehuman.com/breathwork
- He thinks we want to limit neurotoxin fluoride
- Fluoride is in nature but in very low amounts
- A byproduct of phosphate fetilizer is fluoro-silicic acid (if keeps in the fertilizer it would kill the plant)
- We put it into water supply under the disguise that it prevents tooth decay
- Also use it also in medical sterilization, electroplating, Glas etching
[14:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JlfJEVWPJUQ&amp;t=892)
- Single vs cumulative dose of toxicity:
	- If a toxin is save in low dose its often allowed and seen as save
    - In Europe often use cumulative dose
    - Most foods are gmo cause they spray them with glyphospate and otherwise it would kill the seed
	     - Glyphospahate is in roundup
- The information about the studies where held back until a court order
- Flouride crosses the blood brain barrier thus directly effect the brain
- It also generates free radicals, causes several toxic effects in the brain, also cause of several pathogenic conditions of the brain
- Also crosses placental barrier and reaches the fetal brain (so for pregnant women not good)
	- Also bad for teens
- Toothpaste with fluoride has warning lable that says if children under age 6 and they swallow it then you should call poison control
[16:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JlfJEVWPJUQ&amp;t=997)
- Look for water filtration system best would be reverse osmosis
- At least get chlorine and fluoride out of water
- After its been under reverse osmosis add minerals back in water (Celtic salt)
- He does hydrogen water after the reverse osmosis
- There is all sorts of flouride free toothpaste]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+is-fluoride-lowering-iqs-why-tap-water-needs-to-be-filtered-from-your-life-for-good-gary-brecka.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Is Fluoride Lowering IQs Why Tap Water Needs to Be Filtered From Your Life For Good - Gary Brecka.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 11:09:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Is Honey a Better Substitute for Sugar]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- It's harder for the body to convert plant oil into DHA and EPA
- Inexpensive fish oil is often very low quality so he wouldn't consume it
- Virgin cod liver oil is better
- Larger fish are higher in mercury
- The more selenium the less mercury effect in body

- He started with organic white rice (he rinses it 7 times
- He didn't feel good with rice
- He would eat vegetables again but he doesn't feel good when eating them
- Also with white potato's he didn't feel good
- Some vegetables acummulate heavy metals when grown in soil that has heavy metals
- He eats raw milk with honey

- Sucrose drives up FGF21
- Signals brain more blood flow to certain region in brain
- Creates a protection effect where a healthy person won't overeat sugar
- Also increase in metabolic effect
- In people who are overweight that doesn't happen
- So they think you should look at a metabolically person different then a overweight one
- A healthy one shouldn't worry about carbs, Paul also eats more carbs based on activity level
- He doesn't think that good carbs cause insulin resistance

- Paul thinks you won't get sick cause you have excess energy
- People get not obese cause they have excess energy they get obese cause they don't make energy out of fuel
- You need to move fuel through electro transport chain
- when metabolically healthy then you need to go high before you overdo it
- When you have the right nutrition thus energy you want automatically to move
- Food quality is the foundation

- How thinks the key things that disrupt energy production are:
	- Access linoleic acid from seed oils
    - lipopolysachharide from a disordered gut
- Linoleic acid gets stuck in our membranes
- When messed up gut the energy metabolism will be also messed up
- Saturated fat is protective against lps

- We are made to even life on suboptimal food for survival
- Book smarter not harder
- Phytic acid is not good for the bones
- Animals can eat it cause of 3 stomaches, they can make phase to break down phytic acid
- Phytic acid steals you minerals
- Is in oatmeal
- Vegan diet isn't healthy nor is it environment friendly (creates nutrient deficiency)
- Also defense chemicals can inhibit you being able to take up nutrients from other meals too]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+phytic-acid-and-anti-nutrients.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Phytic acid and anti-nutrients.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 15:45:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Polyunsaturated Fats Breakdown- Omega-3’s vs Omega-6’s]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- This plays huge role on impact of there function in the body
[4:59](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oH7BtQjAu1Q&amp;pp=ygUSb21lZ2EgMyB2cyBvbWVnYSA2&amp;t=299)
- Both compete for same enzyme
- both need desaturated to be broken down
- Omega 6 even prevents conversion of omega 3
- Omega 6 is in mostly plant oil, soy, sesame
- Omega 6 drive inflammation]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+polyunsaturated-fats-breakdown-omega-3’s-vs-omega-6’s.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Polyunsaturated Fats Breakdown- Omega-3’s vs Omega-6’s.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 08:42:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Recover Faster, Fight Neurological Issues & Reverse Signs of Aging with Red Light Therapy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Red light had a lot of articles about it
- Red light therapy was comparable to anti depressants
- Benefitial for the immune system (so if you take medication that suppresses it that's not good)
- Red light therapy for exercise recovery (study about it, better recovery when done before workout)
- Most benefits you can get from red light you actually also get by sunlight
- When buying a red light panel it should have following wavelengths (680-720 nanometers, specifically has 810 one and 940)
- Also for post surgical repair
- Also studies showed reduction in reactive nitrogen species, reduction in prostaglandins
- Reduction in inflammation in brain, reduction in abdominal fat
- Good for wounds, lungs, spinal chord
[7:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLso7-yRUc&amp;t=474)
- We have organell called mitrochondrial in cells (we have 110 trillion of these in body, actually 10% of body weight is actually mitrochondria)
- Inside mitrochondria there's a little motor its called the Kreb cycle (its what generates ATP)
- ADP is the actual life force as humans
	- The more adp the more energy our system has at a cellular level
[10:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLso7-yRUc&amp;t=654)
- When light passes through skin it reduces inflammation, increases microvascular circulation
- Also at certain wavelength go to mitrochondria and kick out mitrochondrial nitric oxide and instead oxygen now can bind to the cell which leads to more efficiently (16 times more energy)
[14:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLso7-yRUc&amp;t=893)
- Red light on scalp can regenerate hair follicles and thicken them, and increase the nutrients to the roots]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+recover-faster,-fight-neurological-issues-&amp;-reverse-signs-of-aging-with-red-light-therapy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Recover Faster, Fight Neurological Issues &amp; Reverse Signs of Aging with Red Light Therapy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 17:50:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Seed Oils, The Dirty 8 That Are Destroying Your Health - Ultimate Human Short with Gary Brecka]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- To basic types of fatty acid in body
	- Saturated fat (typically solid at room temperature)
    - Unsaturated fat (liquid at room temperature)
	    - Mono unsaturated fats
        - Polyunsaturated fats
    - Most of tissues in body are made out of saturated fat and mono unsaturated fat (that's why we have increased intake need for those both)
    - We need to reduce the polyunsaturated fats cause they are not as highly required
    - Polyunsaturated fats are omega 3 and omega 6 but research shows that the high consumption of omega 6 and especially linoleic acid that's bad
[4:25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhbg11rd6g&amp;t=265)
- All dead oils are high in polyunsaturated fats and low in saturated fats
- The omega 6 fatty acids are easily oxidized which can cause free radicals damage to cell membrans and can damage mitrochondria
- Oxidized fats get trapped in cell membrane and can cause inflammation and poor cellular function
- In 18 hundreds machines where lubricated with synthetic seed oil, processed foods has a lot of that fats
- Glutathione main antioxidant in the body (polyunsaturated fats reduces its production), every cell has glutathion
- Seed oil oxidation is also linked to poor immune system, and increased insulin ressistance
[5:31](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhbg11rd6g&amp;t=331)
- We blame increased cholesterol for heart disease
- Seed oils cause LDL cholesterol to oxidize which causes formation of a thome cell (so cholesterol itself is not the bad guy its oxidized one)
- Also study showed that with consuming seed oils there is increased uv radiation damage and also higher risk of skin cancer
[6:20](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhbg11rd6g&amp;t=380)
- Seed oils also often contain bad chemicals like hexane
- It's also heated to high temperature which turns them rancid
- Also sometimes deodorized with sodium hydroxide, carcinogen hexane (known neurotoxin)
- Also often GMO
- They also become trans and hydrogenated fats when often heated (they then release oxidizing free radicals into our system)
[10:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhbg11rd6g&amp;t=603)
- Dirty 8 seed oils:
	- Corn oil
    - Conola oil (rape seed)
    - Cotton seed oil
    - Soy oils
    - Sunflower oil
    - Safflower oil
    - Grape seed oil
    - Rice brand oil
[12:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhbg11rd6g&amp;t=753)
- What oils to use:
	- Limit processed foods
    - Avoid dressings with these seed oils
	    - Will put some good ones on his website
    - For cooking:
	    - Grass fed butter
        - Ghee butter
        - tallow
        - Coconut oil
    - Benefits of them:
	    - Won't denature when heated
        - Less linoleic acid
        - Good ratio of omega 3 to 6
        - Not oxidize or get rancid when heated
    - At room temperature:
	    - Extra virgin olive oil
	        - Best is brand from Italy and cold pressed
            - Look at label and look if it is if used or diluted with other seed oils
    - He eats lot of nuts that are low in linoleic acid
	    - Macadamias
        - Cashew
        - Pistachios
        - hazelnuts
    - Wild caught vs farm raised fish:
	    - Go for wild one cause there is big difference between them
    - With meat eat grass fed (finished meat)]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+seed-oils,-the-dirty-8-that-are-destroying-your-health-ultimate-human-short-with-gary-brecka.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Seed Oils, The Dirty 8 That Are Destroying Your Health - Ultimate Human Short with Gary Brecka.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 07:53:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Should You AVOID DAIRY - GRASS-FED Vs.

- Vegetables with a lot anti nutrients aren't that good
- List of vegetables with low oxalates, phytic acid and low anti nutrients:
	- Mushrooms
	    - Vitamin D2
    - Onions
	    - Most potent source of inulin (good for microbiome)
        - Quercetin (helps anti oxidant production)
    - Avocado
	    - Technically is a fruit
        - High in potassium
    - Bean sprouts
	    - With sprouting you break down anti nutrients and also make new nutrients available
        - Vitamin C
    - Radishes
	    - Good source of fiber
- More in the oxalates category:
	- They blood mineral absorption
    - Cooking vegetables break them down
    - Brussel sprouts
	    - Rich in indole.3 carbinol which converts and helps to break down the toxic estrogen
    - Garlic
	    - Low in oxidates
        - Increase in natural killer cells and tells (immune system more active in good way)
        - Decrease of length and severity illnesses
    - Bok choy

- Two types of fermented food
    - Wild fermenting foods (naturally ferment on its own, like sauerkraut/kimchi)
    - Others influenced with starter cultures (kefir, kombucha, yoghurt)
- No real difference between the benefits
- Data shows dairy based food have the strongest impact
- Yoghurt seems to be best for microbial diversity
[4:39](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7AKzXAPFuuk&amp;pp=ygUVYmVzdCBmZXJtZW50ZWQgZm9vZHMg&amp;t=279)
- Kefir similar to yoghurt but different culture
- Better for people with sensitive gut cause contains galactosidase producing bacteria
- Galactosidase hydrolysis lactose so helps it break down, thus 30% less lactose content
[5:43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7AKzXAPFuuk&amp;pp=ygUVYmVzdCBmZXJtZW50ZWQgZm9vZHMg&amp;t=343)

    - Not really much evidence
    - Only vitro studies
    - Also added sugar into it to just create the effect
[7:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7AKzXAPFuuk&amp;pp=ygUVYmVzdCBmZXJtZW50ZWQgZm9vZHMg&amp;t=468)
- Sauerkraut:
    - There is a random e double blind study on it
    - It had effect on people with IBS but when looked at microbiom there wasn't big change
    - So it could be cause it has good prebiotic effects
    - If people drank sauerkraut juice there was anti oxidants effect called kaempferol and also increase in glutathione products

[12:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nHFdSLOScXI&amp;t=727)
- He thinks animal proteins have better digestibility and utilization over plant ones
- Also lack or smaller amount of amino acids in vegetables
- Plant based ones also have bigger amounts of heavy metals
	- 70% of it had it
    - Organic even higher levels
- Animals could have heavy metals too if they eat not high quality food
- Worst protein is soy protein
	- Lower androgen receptor density and testosteron needs those to bind
    - Also tofu
- Fermentation often detoxifies plants
	- With cabbage (before is harmful for thoride cause it inhibits a nutrient)
- Animal protein:
	- 3 types (beef, whey, egg)
	    - Same bioavailability
        - Whey higher in amino acid cysteine (increases glutathione)
        - Beef protein higher in glycine (also in creating glutathione involved but also collagen)
        - He thinks whey and beef is more beneficial
    - Paul has his own powder
    - Raw food always have risk of contamination (raw fish/spinach)
    - Milk would also have raw whey that would probably be beneficial (but hard to get)
    - If you use a protein powder the look for the COA (look if the company tests for heavy metals and PPA)
	    - PPA is androgen disrupting compound
[16:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nHFdSLOScXI&amp;t=960)
- Whey protein vs. whey isolate:
	- In a concentrate there is lactose
    - Hard to get colostrum (there is powder but doesn't is as effective as the real one directly of the cow)
    - isolate just protein
    - Thomas gets 200g protein and he ways 185 pounds

- Ground beef is good
- If only eat lean meat there are potential benefits to include collagen in the diet
	- Bone broth has collagen in it

	- Heavy metals cause out of fish
- Lots of collagen in general has high heavy Metall amounts
- Pauls also has supplements for organ foods

- Most healthy thing for a infint is breast milk
- Raw vs pasteurized milk:
    - Heat kills bacteria but I'd doesn't get rid of them so you simple drink the dead bacteria
    - Also all Enzyms (proteins) are killed, which would be beneficial
	    - Has list of them on board in the video
        - Gets rid of lactase (breaks down lactose) which you need if you have lactose intolerance
        - So raw milk has lots of good bacteria
    - 2500 proteins in milk
    - Also 400 types of fatty acids that are destroyed with homogenize it
    - Homogenization is when break down fat in little parts
    - Has wulzen factor (good for stiffness)
    - He doesn't drink raw milk he uses raw milk products (raw milk cheese, kefir, sometimes joghurt)
    - With raw milk products more bioavailable calcium and fat soluble vitamins
    - Also alkaline phosphate enzyme (is anti inflammatory)

- we try to go from sugar to fat burning
- Appetite goes
[4:34](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=274)
- Skip or push breakfast further back
- Rule of thumb don't eat when not hungry
- If have carbs for lunch and dinner you'll be hungry next day
- Could do bulletproof coffee
- Can do tablespoon of mc2 oil
- Cortisol peaks at 8 in morning (could be hungry cause of that, but that's not really being hungry)
- If doesn't go away feel deezy tired and weak then eat
[7:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=424)
- With first meal add some fats to end of meal (olives, cheese, nut butter, fatty meat), helps to fast longer
- Also low carbs
- Same with dinner
- Healthy keto is not only going lower in carbs but also eating nutrients dense foods
- Don't snack
[10:56](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=656)
- When insulin resistance nutrients aren't absorbed that good
- Apple cider vinegar (has acidic acid)
- Acidic acid helps reduce blood sugars
- Lemon in water also good (vitamin c, also helps against kidney stones)
- Sometimes when fast uric acid goes up
[13:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=809)
- Other good thing are vegetables
- Maybe big salad
- Should be eaten in beginning of meal, cause if eat protein first then you are likely filled up already
- Fiber feeds microbiome
- Gives potassium and magnesium (helps insulin, gives energy, prevents cramps)
- For Salat need more but for vegetables less amount
[15:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=937)
- Usually cholesterol goes down but for some goes up
- If burn fat certain part of it is cholesterol, and triglycerides used for energy
- If liver is fatty or you don't have gal bladder then lack to get rid of cholesterol
- If these the lipids you find you'll have lots of LDL but not the bad one (small particle one) rather the good ones (big partial, only when do lots of carbs you find those)
- After 14 days 50% of fat in liver will be gone
[16:41](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=1001)
- Green tea is good cause helps insulin resistance
- Other good ones are cinnamon, Garcinia, ginger, ginseng
[17:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=1021)
- When exercise he doesn't recommend pre or post drink
[18:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=1112)
- There are symptoms of fasting like keto fatigue, keto flu, cramps, thyoride symptoms
- All that means you are sufficient in certain nutrients
- Make sure to take b vitamins (recommends nutritional yeast), and electrolytes (electrolyte powder with trace minerals, link in bio of one)
[25:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfzjRoalWM&amp;t=1527)
- Mistakes:
    - Small snack (only two things that don't trigger insulin and that's fiber and fat, so either do MCT oil so pure fat, or something very fiberous like salarie)
    - Little bit of carb is also not beneficial
    - Thinking it will happen quick
    - Everything is in balance is not true]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr.-berg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+The MOST Important Intermittent Fasting Basics for Beginners MUST WATCH - Dr. Berg.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 06:43:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+The problem with eating plants]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- When using a part of a plant for medicine in western medicine we are always aware of the side effects
- In food sphere you don't consider that certain compounds of plants can have side effects
- We should weigh the benefits and the side effects
- He thinks there is nothing net beneficial in the plants
- As a plant it created defence chemicals to survive
- Plants want to spread their seeds
- What we typically think of as a vegetable are leaves/steams/seeds, nuts, grains, peas/roots
- Thinks plants want you to eat fruit (cause colorful, sweet)
- He thinks we are omnivorous humans
[12:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HEET13WvR5I&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=720)
- If thrive why change anything
- Shows studies
	- Shows warfare between plants and animals
    - Few defence chemicals of plants have been tested
[28:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HEET13WvR5I&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=1681)
- Tribes don't care about vegetables
- Hot spices influence leakiness of gut
	- So with pepper, paprika
    - Open tight junctions of intestine
[43:30](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HEET13WvR5I&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=2610)
- Meta-analysis looking if vegetables have a Positiv effect
- There are also no studies that show that vegetables are bad
- Oxidates are a defence chemical that can cause problems
[58:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HEET13WvR5I&amp;pp=ygUYcGF1bCBzYWxhZGlubyB2ZWdldGFibGVz&amp;t=3485)
- High oxalate plant foods
	- Tumeric is very high
    - spinache
    - No benefit in them
- Black pepper inhibits detoxification within the same meal
- Also phytic acid is a big defence chemical
	- Isn't better cooked (was thought that it is)
- Soy food decreases sperm count
- Psoralens in foods will effect our sensitivity to uv light]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+the-problem-with-eating-plants.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+The problem with eating plants.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 15:43:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+The real cause and cure for dandruff]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Normally monthly cycle where the scalp resets
- Head and shoulders uses zpt (anti fungal, bacterial, toxic for reproduction organs)

- It's a overgrowth of malassezia fungus (normally we have it)
[3:45](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=225)
- In the root there is basically a imbalance of the microflora of the scalp
- This fungus eats fat (but it only likes saturated fat, likes to eat triglycerides doesn't like omega 6)
[4:15](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=255)
- The true cause is in the gut flora
[5:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=329)
- Antibiotic kills bacteria but the problem is you also kill bacteria that keep your fungus under control
[6:11](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=371)

- First thing to fix it is put back in microflora
- 1tb of kimchi + water and then put that on scalp wait 15min (so you put probiotic back)
- Other option is 2tb olive oil, 1/2tb coconut oil rub it in then leave over night
[8:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=490)
- Next recommendation is to fix the diet:
- Low carb, low omega 6 oils, probiotics (sauerkraut, kimchi, kiefer), no sugar
- This yeast or fungus loves sugar
[10:09](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x365pPLtNJo&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=609)

- Safety:
	- Experiment where raw milk not develop fungus and pasteurized one did
    - Raw milk has lot of things in it that keep it from becoming a pathogenic breathing ground
    - There are lot of farms that do raw milk in big amounts and do testing that its save
    - Also when raw milk came up there were worse hygienic conditions
[6:06](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0WTAtmElg&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=366)
- Gut benefits:
	- Lot of studies
    - Children growing up with drinking raw milk have less risk of asthma, Enzyms and allergies
    - Also improves there immune system
    - Raw cow milk had same protective effect then breast milk for children
    - Also reports of women who struggle with breast feeding then drink raw milk and improve there ability
    - Also benefits human gut (changes microbacteria positively, also fix damaged gut)
[6:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0WTAtmElg&amp;pp=ygUJcmF3IGRhaXJ5&amp;t=396)

- Lactose intolerant:
	- Raw milk has bacteria that get rid of lactose
    - Also fermenting the milk results into lower lactose
    - Can make kefir yourself
    - Also could do raw cheese (Parmesan reggiano, raw butter)
	    - If want raw cheese don't want it to be heated over 102-103 fahrenheit
    - Raw butter is very valuable]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+this-superfood-is-illegal-all-about-raw-milk.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+This SUPERFOOD is ILLEGAL All about RAW MILK.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 17:41:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Use Probiotics for Dandruff]]></title><description><![CDATA[

[1:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=76)
- caffein acts as a strong reinforcer (we like foods and drinks more)
- 90% of people consuming caffeine
[7:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=423)
- Glp-1:
	- is a Molecule that's found in certain caffeinated drinks
    - Benefitial for weight loss, mental performance and controlling blood sugar levels
    - Acts on brain and body
    - Reduces hunger by
	    - activating certain neurons in the hypothalamus
        - And acts on certain receptors on the gut to make us feel full
    - There are animals that use that to not eat for a long time
    - Also drug that intimitates glp-1 (effective against obesity and diabetes, but those should only be used in extreme cases)
    - Promotes thermogenesis (is utilization of metabolic energy)
	    - Beige, brown fat cells are fat cells you want more off (they generate heat, have lot of mitrochondria)
        - Helps convert weight into brown/beige ones
	        - Cold shower has same effect
        - Also raises base energy burning
    - Other ways to release it is fasted exercise and certain formes of exercise
- Yerba mate:
	- Yerba mate stimulates the glp-1 release
    - Smoked variants are carcinogenic (pro cancer causing)
[20:38](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1238)
- Caffeine Benefits for mental and physical performance:
	- Has certain neuroprotective effects (increases Neuro modulators like Dopamin/catecholamines/norepinephrine)
	    - Increase motivation, drive
    - Has antidepressant effects
    - Positiv effect on mood
    - Can improve mental and physical performance
	    - If not lot of food and blood sugar not high then we increase alertness within 5 minutes, peak in 30 min and holds on till 60 min
        - Caffeine improves reaction time of brain and body
        - Better to access circuits of learning and memory
[27:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1620)
- Caffeine in nature:
	- It's acting as a reinforcer of experience
    - Reinforcer
	    - Can be applied to conscious reward (financial, recognition)
        - But also ways caffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in body that act as reinforcers thus they are subconscious
    - Study on that
	    - Lot of plants contain little of caffeine and we won't notice it, or other favours are stronger
        - The caffeine in flowers acts as reinforcer for the bees (they prefer those flowers)
[27:13](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1633)
- Caffeine stimulates the reward pathway in different way then addiction/reward
[34:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2050)
- Caffeine impacts adenosine which then offsets sleepiness
- Effects of caffeine are largely subconscious
- Reinforcing agents:
	- If feel bad then you also reinforce that you will less likely drink the beverage again
    - So strong can also cause vomitting
    - Caffeine exact opposite
- People will like bitter taste of things more due to coffein
[36:15](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2175)
- Caffeine increases Dopamin receptors in the reward pathway (Positiv things have more potent effect)
- Reduces feeling of fatigue and sleepiness
[41:14](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2474)
- Caffeine binds to two types of adenosine receptors (A1, A2 receptors)
- Adenosine makes us feel tired cause it taps into ATP pathway
- When caffeine binds to adenosine receptors it prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components of energy pathway and cyclic amp increases
- You only borrow energy don't really create new one
- You rather just change the timing of the sleepy signal
- When wake up in morning (provided you sleeper well) will be as low as they can get
- To really get adenosine low you should avoid caffeine in first 90 to 120 min of waking (cause there is a way to complete clear out adenosine in that time)
- Before we didn't use caffeine we where more or less bond to the light cycle
- Healthiest schedule is working on day and sleeping in the night
- Adenosine in direct proportion to how long you've been awake
- The only way to clear out adenosine is to sleep, or take a nap, or viewing morning sunlight, also intense exercise can decrease it
[47:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2827)
- Tool:
	- Dose:
	    - Not everybody will respond same way
        - For most people 1-3mg caffeine per kg bodyweight is range where it will has Positiv effect
        - Start on lower amount if start out
        - Timing relative to tasks/sleep
        - Is one dose per sitting (not throughout day)
        - So if want more times of a day then can use the amount and then separate it to different times
    - Tolerance without feeling anxious:
	    - Preexisting Disposition (genetic, how much stress, etc.)
        - And how caffeine adapted you are (if alert and relaxed then probably not adapted)
    - Too much not really that good
[1:02:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3756)
- Delayed caffeine intake:
	- 90-120min after waking up
    - People who drink the caffeine directly when waking up typically have a afternoon crash
    - If ingest caffeine within 8-10h even 12h before sleep that disrupts sleep
    - Some need short nap, or non sleep rest for 10-30min in the afternoon which is healthy
    - when delaying you offset the afternoon crash (due to adenosine being delayed and then caffeine effect go away)
    - Has own episodes on sleep and a toolkit on his website
    - To clear out adenosine completely is to spike the cortisol
	    - Chronic cortisol bad, normal one good, enhances the efficientcy of our body
        - Good when released to cycadian cycle so at right time with right amount
        - Late shifted cortisol peak is one marker of depression
        - Want early cortisol peak early in day, can achieve that by getting bright light in eyes (go outside 20-30min is good)
	        - Increased peak when sunlight until 1h of waking
[1:05:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3954)
- Also has toolkit for fitness (he follows that program)
- When exercise in morning then can take caffein
	- It will increase afternoon fatigue though
[1:14:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4440)
- Coffee has quarter life of 12h, so 25% of caffeine effect is still there after 12h
- Caffeine on empty stomache more intense effect
- To offset jitteriness you can take theanin
- He its his first meal at 11am and last mealn at 8pm (not set in stone though)
- If use caffeine 2-4 times a week then not regular user (regular is everyday for last 2 weeks)
- If really want the best effects then either take some days off it or use it on empty stomache
- Caffeine is a diaretic so we lose fluid thus sodium, so make sure to consume at least equal amount of water (and add little salt to water, this will offset jitteriness)
[1:14:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4444)
- Theanin not that good before bed if vivid dreams/night terrors/sleep walking
	- Is in green tea
- Tends to stimulate glutamate and Glutamin pathway
- general effect is to compete for the receptors of certain neurotransmitters (all excitetory ones)
- Theanin does decrease alertness a little bit
- 200-400mg of it are effective to offset the jitteriness
- Also data on reduction do depression and anxiety when taking it, also increase in Funktion of blood vessels
- Pro sleep effect when taken before sleep
- Peak of theanin is after a 1h
[1:26:22](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5182)
- One myth about caffeine is that it can increase osteoporosis (if enough calcium in diet no problem)
- Other myth is that reduce/increase testosterone/estrogen (no real consistent changes, but increases sexhormone bonding globulin which effects free testosteron/estrogen)
- Testosteron/estrogen control a lot of sexual function that's why we need it
- Caffeine has positiv effect on depression
[1:28:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5312)
- Sleep:
	- Foundation of health (most important thing you can have)
    - Avoid caffeine intake 12h before sleep
    - Author of the book why we sleep also talks about that
[1:44:18](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6258)
- Caffeine and performance:
	- Improves reaction time/ coordination/memory/focus/mood
    - In physical performance improves power output/insurance/feeling good while exercising
    - A lot of studies show that these metrics are improved
    - The way in which caffeine is taken is important (used abstinence of users in most studies)
    - Book by Michael Pollan all about caffeine
	    - Most people don't even know there basic ability cause they always drink caffeine
    - Could abstine from caffeine for improving physical performance (higher effect then just taking caffeine)
	    - If want max effect then abstine for 20 days (ingest then 30min before performance)
        - Could also do 5 days (also some study that 2 days already has benefits)
    - People best perform with mental tasks when on same state that they learned
    - If not accustomed to caffeine then shouldn't take caffeine at the day of performance
[1:46:22](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6382)
- Caffeine effects on menstrual cycle
[1:52:44](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6764)
- Memory:
	- 30min before mental task is benefitial
    - But also case that after learning can increase memory (cause spike of adrenalin)
	    - Effect I learned in [[{Fluent forever]], cause its effect when under adrenalin and have to remember it is helping memory
        - Would do that by cold exposure, or could be to take caffeine after
    - Maybe could use that for affirmation/visualisations that the brain thinks the statements (thoughts) are more important
    - We eighter can have Dopamin spike (positiv surprise), adrenalin (can be both Positiv and negativ)
    - Increase in catacolamins lock in memory for things that leaded to their increase
    - Could even combine that with cold shower
    - 10-50min intense exercise also increases the memory of the things we wanted to learn prior
[1:56:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6976)
- Nap and caffeine (Napa chino):
	- Not really good cause take caffein in afternoon
    - 90min naps or NSDR all increase dopamine and also improve mood alertness on its own
    - Also caffeine probably reduces the effects of the nap
[1:59:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7192)
- Study run treadmill and eighter caffeine or not
- Looked at neurotransmitters (dopamine and others), also looked on hormones
- Workout on its own increases cortisol, dopamin and catacolamins and neurotranmitters
- Ingesting caffeine prior to exercise also increases Dopamin release with exercise
	- Has long lasting effect of increase in alertness, focus and motivation even after exercise
    - Dopamine and caffeine act as reinforcer
- So to enjoy exercise more and also the activities that follow exercise
[2:06:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7564)
- Dopamine stacking:
	- If difficulty with motivation then should avoid dopamine stacking (like caffeine, loud music, intense workout)
    - Good when some times
    - Also when stack more then peak will be higher thus also bigger drop
    - If you try to come increase to baseline won't work cause you'll drive the baseline lower and lower
    - Don't want to get in the habit of doing it every time
    - Be aware on how you feel after the dopamine goes away
    - Also don't stack to many stimuli
[2:08:37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7717)
- So using caffeine every other day is also good
- 3-4 days a week
[2:11:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7914)
- It might be that caffeine reduces some of the probability of getting parkinson's and Alzheimer's
- Caffeine has neuroprotective effect
- Also evidence when taken with aspirin it reduces headache
- Helps with asthma
- Improves attention in ADHD patients
[2:20:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8421)
- Caffeine can be placed in every beverage to make us like it
- You can use caffeine as tool for reinforcement
- If sugar craving maybe have something with both caffeine and sugar]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+using-caffeine-to-optimize-mental-&amp;-physical-performance-huberman-lab-podcast-101.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental &amp; Physical Performance - Huberman Lab Podcast 101.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 17:12:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light & Red Light) to Optimize Health - Huberman Lab Podcast 68]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- So powerful health impact cause light can be translated into electrical signals/hormone signals in brain and body
- Also can change genes that the cells of body express
[4:10](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=250)
- Niels finson won Nobel price for use of phototherapy for treatment of lupes
- Red light therapy for age related vision loss (red light exposer needs to be early in the day)
[15:49](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=949)
- Physics and biology of light
    - Biological means how converted into signals for body
    - Light is electromagnetic energy
    - Energy can cause reaction in cells of body, plants
    - Light has many different wavelengths (white light has all wavelengths)
    - We can't see every wave length (infrared, ultraviolet)
    - Different wavelengths can penetrate tissue in different depths
[19:38](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=1178)
- How light penetrates tissue
    - Red and infrared are longer wavelength
    - Blue/green/ultraviolet light doesn't penetrate tissue very easily cause it has a short wavelength
    - Long wavelengths can penetrate through skin, maybe it goes even down to the bone
    - So different wavelengths impact different levels
    - Different wavelengths of light are also best absorbed by different organelles within the cells
    - Organelles are different compartments and functions in cells
    - So these functions can be stimulated by light
[27:41](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=1661)
- Light and body (direct vs indirect signal):
    - Certain pigments/colors in the receiver of light energy absorb different wavelengths of light (like reflection/absorption)
    - Eighter absorption/reflection or passing through of light
    - 3 examples how take light and convert into biological events
        - Photoreceptors on back of eyes (two types rods and cones, have photo pigments in them, rods absorb any wavelength, rods also used in low light conditions, cons 3 types: red/Green/blue, so they absorb either long/mid/short wavelength, they do it with different photo pigments)
        - Other place is skin (it's pigment is called melanin, on top layer of skin we have keratinocytes and melanocytes, melanocytes create pigmentation of skin, way they do it is by absorption of uv light)
        - Every cell of body (if light can access the cells it can change way they function, positive or negative, some cells don't really get the light directly they get it indirect through eyes and skin)
    - Always starts with absorbtion of particular pigments of the surfaces the light lands on
[33:40](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=2020)
- Light can affect our biology in fast/moderately fast and slow ways
- If from dark to very light environment then release adrenalin (fast effect)
- Slow integrating effects (average light information and not the accure one)
- Example is circadian rhythm (amounts of hormones that a released called know at which time we are in year)
- You'll get more or less light each day on average cause earth traveling around the sun
- Light in eye is absorbed by a particular cell type called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells, that communicate to specific stations in brain which connect to the pineal gland
- The light then shuts down the production of melatonin in the pineal gland
- In short days cause little light on average landing on the cells so duration of melatonin release will be much longer
- In summer more light on average hits the cells so duration of melatonin release much shorter
- The environment around thus changes the internal environment (melatonin signals it)
[38:24](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=2304)
- Content of melatonin supplement has to much melatonin in it
- Our own produced melatonin has two effects:
    - Regulatory effects:
        - Positiv impact on bonemass
        - Maturation of gonads during puberty, overview/testes (lowers amount of sperm, that's why you young kids have high melatonin to not get into puberty)
        - Also involved in placental evolvement
        - Powerful impact on central nervous system
        - Effects on waking up and feeling sleepy
    - Protective effects:
        - Can activate the immune system (one most potent anti oxidants, anti cancer properties)
- It's the rise and fall of melatonin and duration of melatonin signal that gives this effects
- Melatonin has slow moderate effects on body
[43:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=2632)
- Optimizing melatonin levels:
    - One of best thing to do is to get proper amount of sunlight each day (proper in context of time of year)
    - Summer month more sunlight in eyes
    - In winter makes more sense to spend more time indoors
    - Changes in melatonin release through year is normal
    - Shouldn't destroy melatonin by getting bright light when going for a pee at night
    - There are function that are specifically there for summer and for winter
    - To bypass it can dim lights or use long wavelengths light (the preceptors that react to bright light to impact melatonin respond to short wavelength light)
    - Amber colored light and red light (unless very bright)
    - Any light that's bright enough will shut down melatonin production
    - Also the melatonin supplement makes it static while normally levels are dynamically changing
[57:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=3472)
- More mating behavior in long days of spring/summer (human and animal)
- 2 mechanism that help with that
    - One is due to melatonin which inhibits testosterone and estrogen output from testes and ovaries
    - Second pathway (parallel pathway), more like an exelerator, exposure to light especially uvb (uv blue light), can trigger increase in testosterone and estrogen and desire to mate (exposure to skin not eyes)
- Skin actually hormone producing/influencing organ
- Mentioned study with mice 48:48
    - When exposed to uvb, if enough increases of that light increase of testosterone/estrogen, teste and ovaries size changed, also better female fertility
    - exposed with light similar to 20-30 min mid day sun exposure, they did it 2-3 times a week
    - It's between night at 10pm to 4am where uvb exposure from artificial source is not good
    - People with darker skin need more vitamin d3 (cause of darker skin you have more melanocytes so more light absorbed)
    - Seasonal changes in testosterone
[1:00:20](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=3620)
- Testosterone levels where lowest in winter and highest in June/July/August/September
- Sun exposure to eyes can increase mood
- Subjects of study had increase in romantic passion
[1:04:23](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=3863)
- Found in the mice that uvb light on skin increased the activity of p53 which is involved in maturation of cell and other functions
[1:11:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=4293)
- Uvb effects tolerance of pain
- Tolerance varies over the ear
- Mentioned two studies
- Nociception is the perception of pain
- Light landing on eyes captured and absorbed then send to areas of brain and then release of endogenous opioids (lead to less perception of pain)
[1:11:59](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=4319)
- If chronic pain sun light exposure could be beneficial
[1:16:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=4614)
- Even on cloudy day get more light then from indoor light
- Never look at any light that is so bright it's painful to look at
- Sunglasses will reflect the sun so it won't work also a windshield
- Don't wear blue blockers outside, and also not good to wear them in morning and daytime
- Can use in nighttime
- Also think about how much cloth put on
- If Depression in winter months (seasonal affective disorder) can be beneficial to get a sad lamp
- We all benefit from more uvb light throughout the year (if done safely)
[1:19:43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=4783)
- He keeps light source on desk throughout the year and also goes outside (gets sunlight in early morning and throughout the year)
- If not that bright outside he will look at the light source more
- People who are pro skin cancer should be careful
[1:22:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=4939)
- Also improved immune function through uvb
- Uvb on eyes triggers activation of the neurons in the sympathetic nervous system (part of autonomic nervous system)
- When enough uvb a specific channel in sympathetic nervous system is activated and the splin deploys immune cells/molecules that combat infection (so part of getting less ill in summer)
[1:26:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=5165)
- In winter should be conscious about getting uvb to improve our splin function
- Also sound healing faster
- Hair also grows faster
- Also improve in skin health
[1:28:02](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=5282)
- If just local light and no involvement with the eyes then the treatment is not as potent
- Typically local skin treatment has high intensity light and if intensity is to high then you can damage the skin, cause you burn a layer off to trigger renewal of new skin cells
- Depends on case
[1:31:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=5508)
- Getting as much uvb to eyes and skin in early day and throughout the day (as safely as possible) be beneficial for mood
- There is one neural circuit that originates with cells in eye that bypasses the cycadian clock that's designed to release dopamine and other endogenous opioids
- Involves Peri perihabenular nucleus, it gets input from the cells in eye that respond to uvb (other bright light) if that pathway is activated at wrong time of day mood gets worse (so avoid uvb in the night, also artificial sources, 10pm - 4pm)
[1:36:43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=5803)
- Study that is about light exposure during sleep effects cardio metabolic function (used 3 and 100 lux)
- App to measure lux
- Lux = light intensity
- Sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin
- Melatonin levels where not disrupted
- Just 1 night of sleep in moderately light environment caused increase in night time heart rate, decrease in heart rate variability (on its own it's a good thing) and increase in next morning insulin resistance (so glucose management suffers)
[1:43:30](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=6210)
- Most low level light therapies involve red light
- LLL therapy has shown to be effective for a lot of things
- Treatment of agne, reduction in skin lesions, wound healing, reduction in scars from agne, sometimes resistance to that agne
- The red and infrared light can pass down to deeper layers of skin where it can change the metabolic function of different cells
- Shining red light on skin, provided it's not burning the skin, so just little damage of upper layer of skin and triggers certain biological pathways within the cells of sabacious gland and stem cells within hair cell niche, so skin gets burned and cells further in get out new cells
- So will work for wound healing, to get rid of scars and some form of pigmentation
[1:48:23](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=6503)
- Also through red light we can improve other cells like for seeing and think better
- Has reviews on LLL therapy
- Not really a review on whole body therapy for improving the skin
- Most Infrared sauna doesn't get hot enough to trigger effects on growth hormone and heat shock proteins and other benefits saunas are known for
[1:59:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=7161)
- Red and infrared light for restoration of neural function as we age
- In retina usually no new cells when age
- Nobody is as cognitive sharp as the used to be when they age
- Red light can increase adp, usually when adp increases energy in cells involving cytochrome c (oxidace, anytime there is ace in biology it's a enzyme so process in decorating and creating molecule)
- Great thing but you get byproduct like ROS (reactive oxigen species), and those change which genes are created in the a cell
- The goal of preventing age or get better with it is to increase adp and decrease ros
- In study People who where in 20s or 40 or older viewed red light about 670 nanometers at distance about foot away and low enough density, used for couple of weeks
    - In people 40 years or older saw improvement in visual function
- As we age we loss's some neurons in retina but not lose cones
- Cons and rods use most energy in body, therefore create lots of Ros as age
- Red light reduced ros
- Neuro retina is only piece of brain that's outside of it
- Reduction in drusen (little fatty deposits), accumulate as we age, the red light was reducing or even reversing the accumulation of drusen
[2:04:26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=7466)
- Exposure of red light needed to happen early in the day
- Could also take bright light and put red filter over it (not to bright that you don't hurt the eye)
- It's 2-3min looking at red light every morning for two weeks or more
- Most panels to bright to look at, so use distance
[2:07:59](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=7679)
- Red light also beneficial in night
- If red light dim then won't effect melatonin production
[2:18:57](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0nqolsNZc&amp;t=8337)
- So by drugs you change how neurons fire like anti depressions, opioids but that's all rather indirect
- There is also electrical stimulation but therefore a piece of skull needs to be removed
- Light would be a good way to effect neurons
- Recent studies showed that light on the eyes can change global patterns of brain
- Gamma activity (one wavelength) that can be restorative for certain aspects like learning
- By certain patterns of light flicker the brain will match those pattern
- Removed things that where there for Alzheimer's]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+using-light-(sunlight,-blue-light-&amp;-red-light)-to-optimize-health-huberman-lab-podcast-68.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light &amp; Red Light) to Optimize Health - Huberman Lab Podcast 68.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 12:02:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance - Huberman Lab Podcast 63]]></title><description><![CDATA[

[1:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=108)
- For some people more salt is good and for some less
[8:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=534)
- Neuropod cells (some sense sugar)
- They respond to sugar and lead to Dopamin release
- Also combined with tasting something sweet
- So that's what leads to craving through hidden sugars
- Artificial sweeteners can have insulin response under certain conditions
- We also have a drive for carbonation
[16:21](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=981)
- Salt has many important functions in the body (for example fluid balance, also desire for salt itself)
- You crave salt when salt storage is low
- Salt also regulates appetite for sugar
- Technically salt is a mineral
- He will be referring to sodium when talking of salt
- 1g table salt has 388mg sodium
[24:12](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=1452)
- we have little clusters of neurons that senses the level of salt in our brain and body
- There are certain brain regions that do this ( those don't have the blood brain barrier)
- Most substances don't have access to the brain (that's due to the fact that the brain can't really heal from injury)
- Overies and testis also have a barrier around them (assumption is thats cause they contain the genetic material)
- Small and critical substances can access the blood brain barrier
- Some regions of brain have a weaker/stronger fence around then
- The areas that monitor salt balance and other functions related to Concentration of salt in body (osmolarity)
- Most important neuron in that region is ovlt (these has neurons that can sense contents of blood and to some extend the Sevierville spinal fluid)
- It basically controls if there is enough/to less salt and communicates with other brain regions if there isn't
- It's an important process without it you are in big trouble and probably dead soon
[24:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=1488)
- Thirst is there cause the neurons in ovlt are detecting changes in bloodstream which detect global changes in body, and in response it sets of certain events that make you eighter want to drink more or stop drinking
[32:09](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=1929)
- Two types of thirst:
- Osmotic thirst (has to do with concentration of salt in bloodstream, when salt concentration of blood is high then sends signals to other areas which lead to some other events, )
- Signals to supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus
- The pituitary gets signaled and from there there is a hormonal signal released called vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), this either restricts the amount of Urin we put out or increase it
- Hypovolemic thirst (occurs when drop in blood pressure , ovlt also has neurons that can detect that, that are baroreceptor/mechanoreceptor types)
- Baroreceptor response to changes in blood pressure
- Things that can decrease blood pressure is loose lot of blood, or some cases vomiting, or diarrhea
- Classic case is loosing blood
- In both variants you'll desire thirst
- Not only about seeking water also about seeking salt (sodium)
- Sodium can help retain water (not always)
[38:31](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=2311)
- Kidney is there for release and retaining of substances of the body (like glucose, amino acids, uria, uric acid, salt potassium, magnesium)
- Basically a very knowledgeable filter
- Blood enters kidney there is the loop (loop makes that keep some substances and some not)
- It response to a voraity of hormonal signals (eg vasopressin)
- Urin is basically filtered blood
- 90% of fluid absorbed in the tubes, and rest when go into distal kidney
- Proximal (close), distal (far away)
- If thirsty for a while kidney gets told by the vasopressin to not release fluid, vise versa when have lot of fluid
[45:25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=2725)
- Vasopressin:
    - Anti diaretic means prevents peeing
    - Also mentioned in a other episode about desire love and attachment
    - Is made at multiple locations of nervous system (mainly supraoptic nucleus)
    - It's also involved in sexual behavior
    - Works at distal part of the liver
    - It prevents the fluid going to the bladder
    - Kidney uses sodium to conserve water (cause sodium can hold water)
    - If estrogen is high there is water retention in the body
    - But estrogen also acts as diaretic but it's all a complicated balance between hormones, salt and fluid
[49:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=2972)
- How much salt do we need
- There are lot of people out there with prehypertension or hypertension (you should know that, meaning blood pressure)
- Blood pressure tells you lot about your health
- There are a lot of studies that show that high salt diet can be bad for tissue and various organs (also brain)
- If salt concentration in brain too high neurons suffer
- But also if to less salt then cells will shrink (cause water taken from them, also there brain function can suffer)
- But also the problem with the studies is that the high salt level is also coupled with other bad nutrition like high carbs
- There are not many studies that looked into high/low and moderate salt intake
[54:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=3269)
- Lower salt in diet can reduce hazardous events (risk of cardiovascular events)
- Paper on it (looked at excretion)
- Sodium and potassium work in concert in the body
- Hazard ratio low is lowish at sodium excretion of 2g per day and continues to go down to about 4.5-5g
- Hazard ratio increases dramatically about 7-8 and towards 12g
- Processed foods tend to have more salt in them
[1:01:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=3667)
- If high blood pressure should be cautious
- People with low blood pressure can benefit from increase salt intake
- Blood pressure in a part is regulated by sodium intake
- Also paper on it
[1:12:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=4368)
- Determining intake:
	- For most if drink water then you'll excrete the sodium that's to much and vise versa
	- But eating much more sodium then needed is bad cause some organs store sodium
	- If salt levels are low you'll crave salt (follow it if you eat healthy)
	- Should decrease intake of processed foods
	- Also depends on if it's hot or cold (dry)
	- Rule of thumb for workout is galpin equation
	- Normally you are thirsty after taking in salt but if it's mixed with sugar and other things then after a time feel tired (that's you being dehydrated, cause you didn't recognize you need to to drink)
	- The appetite isn't that accurate cause the body will adapt to a certain salt intake after time
	- It also regulates the water release not the only sodium
	- The system basically adapted to availability of sodium in the environment
	- History of salt (was expensive)
[1:16:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=4613)
- Talked about relationships between salt and iodine in other episode (which salt better iodine or not, some people maybe need more or less iodine)
- Iodine has direct effect on thyoride hormone and it's function (relates to metabolism)
- In most causes common table salt is fine
- Sea salt often contains other minerals that can be useful
- You won't get much if any minerals from table salt
[1:24:06](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=5046)
- Salt and stress:
	- Adrenal glands on top of kidneys
	- Make glucocorticoids like aldosterone these impact fluid balance and partly they do that by regulating craving and tolerence of salt we have
	- Study where they remove the adrenals (adrenalectomy)
	- Normally we prefer mild to moderate salty things but when no adrenals then prefer much higher sodium concentration
	- Shows the relationships between the stress system (glucocorticoid system) and the salt craving system
	- Low sodium levels can cause stress and anxiety
	- Makes sense cause stress system is designed to deal with various challenges of the body
	- Stress activates the immune system, long is different
	- So to counteract stressors could take sodium in
	- If sodium to low then ability to meet stressful situations is not that good
[1:28:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=5281)
- Other electrolytes:
    - Most people get there magnesium from their food intake
    - There is some evidence that you can remove muscle soreness by ingestion of magnesium malate
    - Magnesium thryonade for promotion of transition into sleep and perhaps can support cognitive function and longevity (typically taken 30-60 min before bedtime, has other episode on sleep where they talked about it)
    - Also other forms of magnesium
    - Sodium and potassium work closely together (lot of ratio recommendations out there, 2:1 ratio of potassium to sodium)
    - It depends on context
[1:32:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=5549)
- For low carb diets you'll excrete more water and also lose sodium and potassium
- Also with intermittent fasting
- Also caffeine cause it's a diaretic it causes excretion of the fluid in body
- If he drinks caffeine in fasting then he looks that he gets enough salt (like see salt)
- For every oz of coffee or tea consume 1.5 times amount of water and put tiny bit of sodium in
- If exercise while fasting also take in some electrolytes
[1:35:18](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=5718)
- General recommendations:
	- Book the salt fix
	- The authors recommendation was 8-12g salt per day (which is 3.2-4.8g of sodium)
	- 1.5-2 teaspoons of salt
	- Others (4g potassium, 400mg magnesium)
[1:43:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=6207)
- Relationships between salt and sugar:
	- Salt as taste (have salt receptors, neurons that fire when salty taste is there, same as sweet and bitter detectors)
	- They looked at parallel pathways salty taste in mouth and gut
	- Parallel pathways are a essential feature of every sensory system
	- So cause we have more red then greenness then we perceive it as more red then green (visual sensory system)
	- In many processed foods there is a business of putting in hidden sugars (it's a way of bypassing the body's system for sweet, neutralize the taste, to overindulge you in eating, through hidden sugars will crave food)
	- Also concept in cooking where you neutralize taste
	- A lot of food out there has a salt sweet combination (that can lead to you consuming more of it, if it have been just one of the two)
[1:45:56](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=6356)
- The closer the foods are to it's basic for and you only eat that the more accurate the salt craving becomes
- Sugar cravings can also be reduced
[1:52:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=6773)
- Sodium and neural function:
    - Action potential is the firing of electrical activity by neurons (neurons communicate with that)
    - Neurons have inside (their genetic material, things floating around to keep it function, wire extending outwards called axon, at end of axon release Pakets of chemicals that either let the next neuron fire or not) and outside
    - Neurons need to change there electrical activity (has negative charge usually, cause inside has floating around potassium/chloride and little sodium)
    - If the stuff in it is negative charged
    - Outside is positive charged (main factor of positive charge is sodium)
    - When neuron is stimulated by other neuron and the stimulation is high enough then little gaps open up in membrane of cell, that usually separates inside from outside
    - Cause a lot of positive charge outside the sodium rushes into the cell and the charge from the cell goes from negative to positive
    - If certain level of positive charge then it fires an action potential and puts out its own set of chemicals on the next neuron (so becomes a chain reaction)
    - So sodium is the way that neurons communicate with one another
    - The way the cells restore there charge is by pushing the sodium out of the cell, mechanisms for it (sodium potassium pump)
    - So having enough salt in body let's the brain function at all
[1:54:59](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=6899)
- Dehydration:
    - If drink to much water in short time you can actually kill yourself
    - That's called hyponotrimia
    - The problem is you excrete to much sodium quickly and ability to regulate kidney function is disrupted, and also brain actually could stop functioning
    - If the water doesn't have sufficient electrolytes
    - It's also this why dehydration leads to confusion and lack of coordination
[1:58:57](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&amp;t=7137)
- What salt intake best for you?
	- In context of fluid intake, diet, amount of caffeine, of electrolytes more generally]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+using-salt-to-optimize-mental-&amp;-physical-performance-huberman-lab-podcast-63.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Using Salt to Optimize Mental &amp; Physical Performance - Huberman Lab Podcast 63.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 18:53:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Vitamin Deficiencies that cause dry or oily hair - Dr. Berg]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Sebaceous gland responsible for releasing oil (sebum, there to lubricate and protect surface of body)
- If dry:
	- deficiency in fat suable vitamins
	- specific vitamin a (helps regulate the gland)
	- vitamin D and E
	- Not able to absorb it
	- To get the vitamins could use cod liver oil
	- vitamin e from leavy greens, nuts
[3:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aZqhHKB-mKc&amp;pp=ygUYZHIgYmVyZyBmYXR0eSBkYW5kcnVmZiAg&amp;t=187)
- If oily:
	- Can be low zinc (helps to decrease androgens and is DHT)
	- DHT is powerful type of testosterone, makes gland bigger and then makes it produce more oil
	- Other cause is high levels of insulin

- So go on healthy keto and intermittent fasting
- What leads to zinc deficiency (too many grains, history of antibiotics, or eating lot of refined carbs, digestive problem, alcohol, diarrhea, low hydrochlorothiazide-HCL can't absorb zinc and other minerals with it)

- By taking apple cider vinegar and potein-100 chloride can increase trace mineral
- Seafood like oysters, red meat, liver, beef liver are high in zinc]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+vitamin-deficiencies-that-cause-dry-or-oily-hair-dr.-berg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Vitamin Deficiencies that cause dry or oily hair - Dr. Berg.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 06:44:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Wearing Blue Blocking Glasses is NOT a Dumb Idea - Here’s Why]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Melanopsin receives blue light
- Pineal gland shuts of melatonin
- Study where they tested the blue light effecting sleep (with blue light 16 min less sleep and woke up 6.7-7.6 times usually baseline is 4-4.5, also cycadian rhythm shifted by 3 hours)
- Yellow amber glasses block out excess blue light and let in natural one, red ones block out blue and green light and they are there for night time to promote melatonin production.

- Fluoride is a byproduct of phosphate fertilizer, also comes from aluminum
- It can prevent tooth decay (but could get same by just brushing teeth)
- It's 4 times the level in water then what is on toothpaste warning for calling poison control
- Gary brecka believes the dosage determines the poison
- Accumulative toxicity is the problem
- So he thinks fluoride is what needs to be permanently out of our body
- There was a program that was suppressed first (national toxicicology program fluoride)
- Fluoride has effect on neurons
- If have the money for filtering system stage 4 one get one and add back minerals with baja gold sea salt salt or Celtic salt to remineralize the water
- It's hard to filter out fluoride without reverse osmosis
- Also with showering it's not good]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+what-is-fluoride-really.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+What is fluoride really.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 05:40:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Which Fermented Foods Can You Eat on Ketogenic Diet – Dr. Berg]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Intermittent fasting:
	- Dr Volter Longos
    - Huge believer 12h not feeding, with bigger feeding window
    - He does 3 day water fasts sometimes over the year
    - For some its good to fast more
    - We should get data
    - Look at glycemic profile (glucose, hemoglobin A1, insulin)
	    - When more insulin resistant a narrow feeding window can be beneficial
        - If hypoglycemic then not good
    - So 12h on 12h off is the average
	    - Also Thomas also says same
    - When have data then could tighten the window
    - Testosteron and Hormons
    - Often its not hypo production of a hormone its rather the hypo signaling

- Micro dosing with poisons:
	- Often its the accumulative dosage that determines the poison
    - Some poisons (glyphosate, fluoride, chlorine in water, cyanocobalamin, cyanide)
    - It's okay to have small amounts
    - GMO foods bad
	    - Get resistant to antibiotic, thinks this will become a pandemic
    - Organic not clean always (Gary has podcast on it)
	    - Even making more food of it
    - Sitting is new smoking

- 30 days of feeding grains will destroy 200 days of grass fed
[9:23](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EWxYhaaColY&amp;pp=ygUQR3JhcyBmZWVkIHZzIG5vbg%3D%3D&amp;t=563)

- He eats carbs but not a lot
- He eats fruit, honey, sweet potatoes, lentils
- He Phase in and out of keto
- He would have consumed more protein when eating keto
- he would look more on potassium (need 3-4 times more potassium, potassium to sodium)
- He wants to add multivitamin (or organ meat, liver, beef)
	- Has supplement in the description
- He would control his saturated fat intake cause saturated fat in abundance in over chloric state is also going to increase insulin resistance
	- So want to maybe eat leaner meat and then add oil with something else
[12:49](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VnSjz8Sl1oU&amp;t=769)
- Be less carb phobic:
	- Carbs with workout
- It seems that nuts also have high omega 6
- He don't wanted to fear insulin:
	- Insulin isn't always bad
    - He would have measured the levels more
- He would have monitored his cortisol levels more
- He should have monitored his cortisol to DHEA ratio
- He should have followed more what he experienced rather then following the research exactly to the point]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+why-i-quit-keto-and-what-i-wish-i-did-differently-(sincerely).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Why I Quit Keto and What I Wish I Did Differently (sincerely).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:35:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Why I Quit The Carnivore Diet]]></title><description><![CDATA[

[2:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=121)
- Has good benefits
- If feel good with it then keep doing it
- But some struggle with some things (sleep issues, muscle cramps, low libido)
- He had issues after a year
[3:39](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=219)
- He eats meat, fruit, honey and raw dairy
[7:20](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=440)
- Insulin has crucial role to signal the kidney to hold on electrolytes
- He thinks that insulin induced insulin resistance isn't the cause of obesity and diabetes
- Fructose in natural form looks different then with in processed form
- Mice do have a higher amount of turning fructose in triglyceride and fat
- And most studies use high fructose corn syrup
[10:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=601)
- He thinks that keto diets are not good cause there is evidence that keto diets lead to more stress
- Adding carbs to people improves cortisol and recovery with training
- And also improves thoride hormones (essential thermostat of body)
- Study on negative effected thoride hormone by keto diet
- Anyone in keto diet should check TSH, T4, T3, free T3, free T4, reverse T3
- When thoride doesn't work well that's a factor of cardiovascular disease
[12:17](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=737)
- Cortisol stays longer in body with keto diet so not that good
- Diets with 2% carbs in diet there was increased breakdown of protein and lowering of t3
[17:34](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=1054)
- Carbs increase free testosterone and decreases cortisol after training
- Stress hormone went up less
- For him fruit and honey are best carbs with lactose in raw milk
- Has video on honey and raw dairy as well
- Problem with oatmeal is phytic acid, grains are not good source of carbs for humans
- Grains have more defense chemicals, and you need a longer process to be detoxified
- Also beans have phyic acid, and poor source of nutrients
- For some people root vegetables can be better tolerated then grains/beans
[20:09](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=1209)
- There is no study that showed that fruit disrupts metabolic disfunction
- He is not huge fan of fiber (why)
- He also thinks fruit juice (without sugar) is good
- Honey raises testosterone levels in men
- Lower fasting glucose (study in diabetics)
- Protective effect of honey against metabolic Syndrom (review)
[22:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PzX_NS7EwF0&amp;t=1325)
- Thinks Fruit and honey have any effect on deuterium
- Also no evidence that it improves glycation
- Also keto increases glycation]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+why-i-quit-the-carnivore-diet.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Why I Quit The Carnivore Diet.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:35:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Why Paul Saladino Quit Carnivore & Now Eats 300g of Carbs Per Day]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Garry is a fan of Paul Saladino
- There is no tribe that not eat meat
- A lot of illnesses are related to the auto immun system
- Gut is ground zero where Immunsystem is programmed
- Jordan peterson is also anivore and fixed his health
- Inulin signals kidney to hold on to electrolytes, so if don't get a signal we waste sodium
- He thought he didn't have the whole truth when he got problems

- We all share pieces of the truth
- Seeds/nuts/grains/beans all have defense chemicals (have more then food)
- Fruit contains defense chemicals but they decline when the food ripens
- Some people are more sensitive to defense chemicals then others thus vegetables
- If thrive why change anything
[19:02](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=1142)
- Lies they tell you:
	- Meat is bad
    - For everybody vegetables are good (if have illness you eat to less fiber)
- He looked at tribes
- Of course put out Ultra processed food of the equation
- Singapore has one of longest life expectancies in the world and they have one of the highest meat consumptions
- Gary said there was no death of clinically elevated levels of LDL cholesterol
- Also Paul mentioned that usually people that live long have elevated levels of cholesterol
- For people that have issues like fatigue, metal health, anxiety, sleep disturbance, low libido, auto immun conditions, problem of weight loss (for lot of those cutting out vegetable and plant food to test it might be good)
- Gary mentioned that he had a guest that treats people with very bad mental issues that are even drug resistant with keto diet
[20:29](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=1229)
- Hydrogen water feeds a lot of bacteria in gut
- Gary has his own brand

- Rootcause of mental issues is neural inflammation
- There are a lot of pararells with brain and body
- Ultra processed food leads to inflammation
- Table sugar is molecule of sucrus, humans would never had that in nature
- We always had that molecule combined with fiber and thousands of other things
- Probably 5000 components in fruits
- High fructose corn syrup now sneaks into things under natural fruit flavour (actually no fruit most fruit yoghurts)
- High fructose corn syrup also contains traces of mercury and other toxins (Studies about it)
[29:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=1756)
- Paul thinks that Robert lustig talked a little confusing about fructose
- Problem is not fruit and fruit juice the problem is taking away all other information in the food
- Same with seed oils its more a industrial byproduct of a seed
- Canola oil is canadian oil low acid is actually rape seed (they genetically modified a rape seat so its low arsuc acid which is actually banned, still has significant amount of arusc acid)
[38:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=2307)
- Cholesterol is one of main construction material
- It is a necessary thing
- When eat less seed oil and more animal fat then cholesterol goes up
- The western medicine things that there is a direct correlation between amount of apob and the more plaque in ateries (but that's not true)
- When we don't have metabolic disfunction then there is no such relationship
- In native human biology we don't get atherosclerosis in veins we only get it in atteries
- When apob is the problem why are there so much instances where this isn't true
- When you have damage to the endothelium apob is involved
- Damage of endothelium is caused by toxins like heavy metals
- Problem with seed oil studies is that the control group got something with translates which is not good and was banned afterwards
[41:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=2487)
- But there are 3 studies that are good that's the Minnesota corn oil study
	- These studies all found that seed oils where bad
    - It also was suppressed
- Problem with seed oils also fat linoleic acid
- We would never gotten that amount of linoleic acid in our diet cause the seed itself doesn't contain that much
- Cumulative toxicity is in many things also like fluoride
- The more linoleic acid in fat cells the higher cardiovascular disease
[49:56](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=2996)
- It's also in nuts but if tolerate nuts you could eat it
- It's actually in most things but not as highly concentrated as in seed oils
- Both not fan of peanut butter (worst micro toxin)
- Seems that its when oils oxidize
- Flax seed oil also not good
- fish oil also not good cause its easily oxidized
- Also if you really want to narrow it down then also eat grass fed meat
- It's really in pigs, eggs, chicken where the poly saturated fats accumulate, so more linoleic acid when grain fed
- The American heart association got a 1.7 million dollars funded before there where lower cardiovascular disease cause people eat just animal fat
	- Also advertisments from 1960s about poly saturated fats being good
- Thinks over long term seed oils and linoleic acid create insulin resisstance
[52:12](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=3132)
- Gary said that mortality is going backwards which makes no sense cause we have technology advancement
- "The amount required to undo bullshit is 10 times greater then to make up the bullshit"
	- Brandolinis law
- What we learn first in our brain stays
- Also for medical students hard to undo shit they been told, also you get discredited if you are against a common belive
[58:11](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CamFyBFTbmg&amp;pp=ygUWZ2FyeSBicmVja2EgYWJvdXQgZGlldA%3D%3D&amp;t=3491)
- Steps to take to get going:
	- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
    - First step:
	    - cut out ultra procest food
    - If you give organ meats to kids they will easily get used to it
- Paul has meat stick with organ meat in it]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+why-paul-saladino,-md-quit-a-100-carnivore-diet,-impacts-of-cholesterol,-and-the-value-of-insulin.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+Why Paul Saladino, MD Quit A 100% Carnivore Diet, Impacts of Cholesterol, And the Value of Insulin.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:34:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Why You Should Drink Carbonated Water]]></title><description><![CDATA[

- Disease rather happens in us then to us
- Don't supplement for sake of supplementing
- Problem is we don't have data (need to get at least some data)
- ADHD and ADD are actually attention overload disorders (so overactive mind)
- Believes everyone should do a genetic methylation test (will tell you what raw material the body can transform and what not)
[11:22](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=682)
- Basically humans are not working optimally
- While we can't fix the gene we can supplement for it its function
- Most common gene mutation is MTHFR (can't transform folic acid, inexpensive to supplement)
[21:19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=1279)
- 3 biomarkers you need to understand
    - Glycemic profile (how good insulin and sugar metabolism is, 3 markers glucose/hemoglobin A1 is a 3 month average of blood sugar/insulin)
        - Blood sugar root of all evil
    - Hormons (DHEA and protein called shbg)
    - Basic nutrient deficiencies (vitamin D3, magnesium, potassium, vitamin B12)
    - And one that only need one time in life is methylation test (Look at 5 genes MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, AHCY, COMT)
- Anxiousness basically raise of catacolamins same class of neurotransmitters there for fight or flight response
    - Usually those people are deficient in b vitamins (especially b12)
    - Also these catacolabamines could be driven by trauma, the gene mutation, real fear
    - If catacolabamines aren't down regulated then our mind is awake and we are fearful
[22:46](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=1366)
- In 50% of people there is a deficiency in vitamin d3
- Every body has a receptor for it, you make it out of sunlight and cholesterol
- Vitamin B12 deficiency
- 40% would be hormon deficiencies (out of normal range, deficiency in shbg/dhea)
- By putting the raw material in the hormon levels will normalize again
- Glycemic levels very high in most so pre diabetic (is when we overload our body with lots of refined carbs, not only sugar)
[44:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=2656)
- Life insurance companies are very accurate
- In 2008 crisis no insurance company failed
- They know day, time and cause of death
[45:06](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=2706)
- Study where looked at sodium and migrane correlation
- Lots of people have to low sodium (People that go to in a sauna, exercise and don't remineralize)
- If you are deficient then you can supplement with Baja sea salt or Celtic one
[54:53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=3293)
- 5 things to do regularly
    - When wake up drink mineralized water
        - water with Baja gold sea salt, it has a lot of trace minerals
        - Himalayan sea salt not good cause has lots of heavy Metal
        - Celtic sea salt also good
        - He wouldn't use table salt at all
    - Would take DHA/EPA fish oil supplement, omega 3 supplement
    - Then morning routine with sunlight/grounding/breath work/cold shower
[59:49](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=3589)
- We get 3 things from nature its magnetism from earth, oxygen from air and light from the sun
- The further we distance ourself from that things the sicker we become
- We are meant to spend 87% of time outside
- Seed oils are oxidizing in our skin our cancer rates are exploding cause of our diet not the sun
- When we touch the earth we discharge into the earth and you actually change the polarity in the body
- Also see difference in blood after grounding
- The grounding mattresses use the ground wire for grounding
- He has PMF matt, it also gets out electro smog out of body
- To change the pH of blood you need grounding
- The more acidic we become the more sick we become
[1:03:33](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=3813)
- He uses hypermax its based otto warburgs work
- Exercising the diathrem
- Posture also has effect on that
- Presence of oxygen is the absence of disease
- He does wim Hof Style breathwork (does 3 rounds of 30 breaths)
- He thinks if we don't do what we promise ourselves then we lose self confirdence
[1:11:54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=4314)
- Benefits of red light therapy
    - In Literatur called photobiomodulation
    - Different nano meters of light have different effects of body
    - Reduce inflammation, increase microvascular circulation
    - Red light goes through wall of midrochondrial and kicks out gas called mitrochondrial nitric oxide and forces oxygen to dock
    - Instead of normal energy you give the cell through that 16 times more
    - 20 min of redlight
    - Also should expose yourself to sunlight especially the first 45 min of Day (there is no uva/uvb)
    - Also mentioned cycadian circle with relation to sun
    - You can ground/breathwork and get sunlight
[1:13:36](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=4416)
- He thinks hydrogen water is best water to put into the body
- Theres a website called hydrogenstudies.com where there are studies about hydrogen water
- Hydrogen ic gas is also used in therapy against inflammation, improving absorbtion of supplements, improving athletic performance, helps neural inflammation
[1:17:27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=4647)
- Ozempic
    - Is a peptide
    - Good for type two diabetics or significant obesity
    - Not really good though
    - Most weight you use is lean body mass
[1:25:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=5103)
- If you want to put someones life expectancy in half put them into isolation
- It's seen a lot in old people when their wife/husband goes usually they too go
- When the mind surrenders the body does
- Also cells live in community too
[1:28:03](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=5283)
- Mortality exelerates post retirement
- Probably due to loss of purpouse
[1:30:49](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=5449)
- There is something called life insurance life annuity and you basically put both on one person and you can't lose
[1:38:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=5896)
- Genes are like blueprints
- When there are some genes that aren't like they should be they want to find ways around it
- Genes follow the methylation pathway
- Also if certain genes are not that high then higher likely hood of addiction (Cause depleted level of dopamin)
- He have seen cases with even mental diseases like bipolar solved
[1:40:57](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=10enqcw2Qiw&amp;pp=ygULZ2FyeSBicmVja2E%3D&amp;t=6057)
- MTHFR gene mutation is the worst but easiest to fix]]></description><link>https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/source-notes/+world-no.1-biohacking-expert-tested-100,000-people&apos;s-dna.-this-diet-will-kill-you-gary-brecka.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Notes/+World No.1 Biohacking Expert Tested 100,000 People&apos;s DNA.

 <br><br>
<br>Wim Hof style breathwork:

<br>Beginner:

<br>Start with 3 rounds of 5 breaths add 1 breath a day (Goal: 3 rounds 30)
<br>Everything else is the same.


<br>Advanced:

<br>3 rounds of 30 breaths
<br>On 30th breath exhale fully and hold. Then when you can't hold anymore take deep breath and hold again. Then breath normally and start the next round.

<br>Also put your tongue on the top of your mouth when holding the breath
<br>When holding the breath breath and focus on noise around and try to get out of head.


<br>For most efficiency try to use the entire lung and your diaphragm. You should also raise your shoulders and put your belly out.


<br>This should be a part of your routine that you never miss. And its like exercise over time you'll get better at it.


<br><br>
<br>Do it in a sitting or lying position because its normal that you get light headed.
<br>You'll also probably get tingly hands and feet.

<br>We want to cut out:

<br>Ultra processed food with carbohydrates
<br>Sugar and added sugar
<br>Seed oils:


<br>And want to change to better options:

<br>Changing the omega 6 to omega 3 ratio
<br>Healthy fat from animal sources
<br>With meat eat organ food cause its rich of nutrients
<br>For carbs we want to get them from fruit, honey. (150g and for active people 350g)


<br><br>
<br>For now I'll probably also reduce them cause i know they have high amounts of defense chemicals in them. I only will use onion, garlic, avocado and maybe brussel sprouts.

 <br><br>
<br>Shut down ritual:

<br>Have some sort of steps you follow to wind down from work. So reflect on the day, plan what to do the next day. And most important don't work after it.


<br>Journaling + bed time tea:

<br>The previous step goes hand in hand with this step. You'll use Journaling to get all your thoughts out.
<br>Combined with journaling I'll drink my bed time tea which is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Chamomile" data-href="Chamomile" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/chamomile.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">chamomile</a>. 


<br>Stretching/Mobility (optional):

<br>You can eighter stretch through the day while making breaks of work or you can have a own session for it. The best time for such a session would be the evening.


<br>Meditation:

<br>10 min meditation or more depending on your preference.


<br><br>
<br>First of all you should use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sleep > The 12 3 2 1 0 Rule" data-href="Sleep#The 12 3 2 1 0 Rule" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/notes/sleep.html#The_12_3_2_1_0_Rule" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">12 3 2 1 0 rule</a> as a guideline this will make things more easy.
<br>Also avoid blue and bright light (every light if bright enough will disrupt your sleep).

<br>Could use blue light blockers (3-30 min before sleep)    Have to look more into it
<br>Dim the lights and its better to have the lights set up on the floor then the roof.


<br>No caffein within 12h before bed.

 <br><br>
<br>Add pinch of salt (baja sea salt, celtic salt) to water (for minerals, need to look more into that)
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>For every hour awake in the first 10h of the day you should consume on average 8oz (240ml) of fluid. So total amount would be 2.4 liters in the first 10h.
<br>We take the 10h in consideration cause that's when the kidney is mostly active, in the nighttime it downregulates its function.
<br><br>
<br>The galpin formular is used when exercising:

<br>bodyweight in pound/30 = number of oz fluid to ingest every 15-20min on average while exercise


<br>In metric system:

<br>2ml per kg bodyweight every 15-20min


<br><br>
<br>Exercising in hot environment:

<br>Double galpin formular.


<br>Sauna:

<br>Double baseline intake (16oz).


<br>If feeling dehydrated

<br>Then you can drink more like 16oz per hour while feeling dehydrated.
<br>Avoid diuretics (increased fluid excretion)


<br><br>
<br>Thirst is a reasonable guide for when we are dehydrated but it doesn't really keep up with our bodies level of dehydration.

 <br><br>
<br>
Wake up

<br>Without hitting the snooze button (if can't try this: <a data-href="Tool - Waking up early the easy way" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/tools/tool-waking-up-early-the-easy-way.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tool - Waking up early the easy way</a>)


<br>
Dream journal (optional):

<br>I journal my dreams to later on get into lucid dreaming


<br>
Get sunlight, ground yourself, do a breathwork session

<br>Sunlight:

<br>Best to get the sunlight of the first 45 min after sun rise.


<br>Grounding:

<br>Touch grass/dirt/sand simply the ground.

<br>Does the same then <a data-href="PEMF matt" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/PEMF matt" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">PEMF matt</a>.




<br>Breathwork:

<br>Best also within 30 min after waking.
<br>Use wim hof type one mentioned here: <a data-href="Tool - Breathwork" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/tools/tool-breathwork.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tool - Breathwork</a>


<br>So basically you want to get outside stand barefoot on the ground and do your breathing exercise.


<br>
Cold shower

<br>Before the cold shower/plunge you can do a warm shower before if you want.
<br>Do it for 3-6min of 8-10 degree Celsius
<br>Hit the head, back of your neck and your back.
<br>After it warm up naturally.


<br>
Start your day.

<br>
You can also change the order if you wish to but I would do the sunlight, grounding and breathwork together then you get 3 things at once. 

<br>
Additionally you can also add affirmations somewhere if that's what you like to do.

<br><br>
<br>Wait for 90-120 minutes after waking for caffein intake.

 <br><br><br>
<br>At least twice daily
<br>Soft toothbrush (medium/hard ones disrupt the gum)
<br>Circular motions and not to much pressure
<br>Brush the gum lightly (increase blood flow thus it better takes up nutrients, especially if sensitive teeth)
<br><br>
<br>At least twice daily
<br>Glide down and go up with a circular motion
<br><br>
<br>You can eighter use a separater toothbrush or a tongue scrubber.
<br>You need to use both with low force but especially the tongue scrub.
<br><br><br>
<br>I would recommend putting it after the <a data-href="morning routine" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/morning routine" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">morning routine</a> to not waste the valuable time for sunlight exposure.
<br>For breakfast I'll rinse my mouth with water and maybe add a gum (zellies gum). (or even for morning don't know yet)
<br><br>
<br>Put it after lunch.
<br><br>
<br>You can eighter put it before, after or between the <a data-href="Tool - Evening routine" href="https://maccram.github.io/Healthside/tools/tool-evening-routine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tool - Evening routine</a>. If you drink the tea though i would put it afterwards.
<br>The evening is the most important time to brush your teeth.
<br>Whenever eating something and you aren't able or don't want to brush then rinse your mouth with water and get rid of food particles. <br><br>
<br>When you eat anything acidic you want to minimize the time your mouths pH is acidic so you should afterwards rinse the mouth with water

 <br><br>
<br>Basically the problem i had was that once i got used to hitting the snooze button it was much harder to go back to waking up early. 
<br>So ideally you shouldn't ever start hitting it but probably that's not the reality.
<br>But i have a solution that helped me get back to waking up early without much effort.
<br>All the credits goes to Iman gadzhi he actually mentioned the app in one of his old videos.
<br><br>
<br>The app I'm referring to is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://alar.my/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://alar.my/" target="_blank">Alarmy</a>. Its basically a normal alarm app on steroids. And its completely free.
<br>First download the app and follow the next instructions.
<br><br>
<br>Set up the time wake up.
<br>Set a eighter the barcode or photo challenge, go to your bathroom and eighter scan a barcode or make a photo that you can easily recreate every time you wake up. I use a photo of my sink.
<br>Then turn off the snooze function.
<br>So what all that does is that if the alarm goes off you only can turn it off by the challenge and you need to get up and go to your bathroom in order to do it.
<br><br>
<br>Enjoy waking up at the times you want. Literally that's al that you need.

 <br>This is a website where you can learn everything about health.<br>
But always still do your own research and form your own opinion.<br>All the notes come from my personal research (SOURCE NOTES). Based on that information i created the actual NOTES which contain the WHY and HOW. Last i also created TOOLS which are simplified action plans.<br><br>If you aren't familiar with Obsidian then here is a short introduction that you get on what this is based on. Obsidian is a note managing program where you can use links to link notes together, just like you have in Wikipedia. <br>The notes are stored in a so called vault. You can download the Healthside one here:<br>
                        
                            
                            
                            
                            
                        
                        Healthside Obsidian Vault
